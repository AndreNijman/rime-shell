#  tests/lib/headless.sh — the compositor a graphical test runs on.
#
#  Source it; do not execute it.
#
#  ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Nine runners in here used to start quickshell on whatever WAYLAND_DISPLAY
#  they inherited. On a build box that is nothing; on the machine somebody is
#  working at it is a window, or twenty windows, landing on top of them. The
#  usual repair — "skip if the session looks like a desktop" — is advisory, and
#  a runner that CAN fall back to the ambient session eventually does.
#
#  So there is no fallback. Every runner that needs a compositor gets one of its
#  own: a wlroots compositor on the headless backend, in a runtime directory
#  this file created, and the run aborts if the socket it ends up talking to is
#  not inside that directory. tests/run-nav-geometry-test.sh established the
#  shape; this is that shape written once.
#
#  ── The private HOME is not tidiness ────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  A suite that drives SettingsService writes
#  $HOME/.config/rime-shell/src/user_data/settings.json, and a crash midway
#  leaves the developer's live shell at 200% scale. A suite that starts the whole
#  shell also finds $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/rime-agentd/control.sock and starts talking
#  to the sessions a person has open. Both are prevented by the same private
#  directory rather than by remembering not to.
#
#  Fonts are the one thing borrowed back, read-only: fontconfig finds user fonts
#  through HOME, and a run that cannot see them measures .notdef boxes.

# ── the refusals ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Three things have to be true at once, and each has failed somewhere before:
# the runtime dir must not be the one the desktop uses, the socket must be
# inside it, and the socket must not BE the ambient one. The third is not
# redundant — a private dir holding a symlink to the host's socket satisfies the
# first two, which is how tests/run-hypr-configerrors-test.sh reaches the
# session it nests in.
#
# The third test is on identity, `-ef`, and it used to be on the display NAME.
# A name is not an identity, and the difference is not theoretical: a compositor
# in a fresh private runtime dir picks its socket number from that empty
# directory, so it collides with the ambient session's number whenever the
# ambient one is low. Measured on this machine, 2026-09-12, with the desk on
# wayland-1: sway came up on a socket of its own at
# $HEADLESS_W/run/wayland-1, and this function refused it as "the ambient one"
# — a hard FAIL, return 2, for a run that had done everything right. labwc picks
# wayland-0 in the same dir, so on the very common machine whose desk is
# wayland-0 every runner in here would have failed that way.
#
# `-ef` compares device and inode and follows symlinks, so it still catches the
# case the paragraph above describes — a private path that resolves to the
# desk's socket is the same file — and it catches it by being the same file
# rather than by being spelled the same way.

# Every line ends in `|| :`, and that is load-bearing rather than defensive
# habit. This runs from an EXIT trap with the caller's `set -e` still in force,
# and `set -e` exempts only the LEFT operand of an `&&` — so

# then stops before `rm -rf "$HEADLESS_W"` and before `return 0`: the scratch
# directory leaks and the script exits 1 no matter what it measured.
# run-niri-keybinds-test.sh did exactly that — 5 passed, 0 failed, exit 1 — and
# five abandoned sandboxes were sitting in /tmp when it was found.
