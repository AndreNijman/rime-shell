#  PROVENANCE — this file is a copy of rime-os tests/lib/atspi.sh. It is
#  IDENTICAL to that file except for this block, which is the only thing added.
#  Check it rather than believe it:
#
#      diff <(sed '2,26d' tests/lib/atspi.sh) ../rime-os/tests/lib/atspi.sh
#
#  The rime-os copy is 2380456588deea0747dee5562ecb5a11f915236a724324530d7498acdbcceba2
#  at rime-os cb02019f.
#
#  It is duplicated rather than shared because rime-shell's CI checks out
#  rime-shell alone: tests/run-lockscreen-atspi.sh needs a private accessibility
#  bus and there is no rime-os tree on the Arch runner to source one from. The
#  cost is that a fix made in one repo does not reach the other, so: FIX BOTH.
#  The known history is rime-os 15283c02 (the file's origin), af8cbdd4 (a second
#  machine correcting the status-flag paragraph), 23a862b5 (shellcheck),
#  4aae9249 (GSETTINGS_BACKEND=memory, which is what made rime-shell's lock
#  screen read-back measurable at all) and cb02019f (the at-spi helper paths,
#  which differ on Arch). The last two are in both copies.
#
#  The paragraphs below talk about "the greeter" and about suites that live in
#  rime-os. That is deliberate — the text is the original's, and rewording it
#  here would make the two copies diff noisily against each other for no gain.

#  tests/lib/atspi.sh — a PRIVATE accessibility bus, for asking a Rime surface
#  what a screen reader actually receives.
#
#  Source it; do not execute it.
#
#  ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Every accessibility assertion in this repository until now read the QML
#  object tree: `Accessible.name` off a live QQuickItem, `Accessible.role` off
#  the attached object. That is a real measurement and it is not the criterion.
#  The criterion is "screen reader validated", and a screen reader does not read
#  QQuickItems — it speaks AT-SPI over D-Bus and reads whatever the toolkit
#  bridge chose to publish. Those two trees are NOT the same tree: the bridge
#  drops items, collapses wrappers, suppresses names (see the passwordEdit note
#  in test-rime-greet-a11y.sh) and applies its own role mapping. An assertion on
#  the QML side cannot see any of that.
#
#  So this file stands up the real thing: a D-Bus session bus, the real
#  at-spi-bus-launcher, the real at-spi2-registryd, and the accessibility flag
#  set the way a screen reader sets it. What the app publishes onto that bus is
#  then readable with tests/atspi-walk.py, exactly as Orca would read it.
#
#  ── The predecessor's blocker, and what it actually was ─────────────────────
#
#  state/agents/p2-b.md recorded this as not measurable here:
#
#      at-spi2-registryd refuses to activate in a `dbus-run-session`:
#      Activated service 'org.a11y.atspi.Registry' failed: … Permission denied
#
#  That is a true observation with the wrong conclusion drawn from it. The
#  failure is not a sandbox refusing accessibility; it is D-Bus *activation*
#  doing what its service file says. /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.a11y.Bus.service
#  carries `SystemdService=at-spi-dbus-bus.service`, so a dbus-daemon that is
#  asked to activate org.a11y.Bus hands the job to the calling user's systemd
#  manager — the real one, outside the test — which will not start a unit into a
#  throwaway bus it knows nothing about. Permission denied is that handoff
#  failing, not at-spi being unavailable.
#
#  Nothing here is activated. at-spi-bus-launcher and at-spi2-registryd are
#  execed directly against a bus this file owns, and both come up clean.
#
#  ── Private, and checked rather than intended ───────────────────────────────
#
#  The one thing this harness must never do is reach the a11y bus of the person
#  sitting at the machine — /run/user/<uid>/at-spi/bus. That bus belongs to a
#  live desktop session; a test that walked it would be reading, and with
#  DoAction pressing, the buttons of real windows. So:
#
#    * XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is replaced with a fresh 0700 directory before anything
#      starts, and the a11y bus lands inside it.
#    * DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS, DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY
#      are all removed from the environment first, so nothing can be inherited.
#    * atspi_start REFUSES to continue unless the address it ends up with is a
#      path inside that directory. An ambient address is an abort, not a
#      fallback — the same rule tests/lib/headless.sh applies to compositors.

    # few lines below, and it does not hold them in a variable: it backs them
    # with the GSettings key org.gnome.desktop.interface toolkit-accessibility.
    # With the default dconf backend, WRITING that key needs the
    # ca.desrt.dconf.Writer service — which cannot be activated here, because
    # the private session bus above is deliberately given an EMPTY service
    # directory. The write is then dropped and the D-Bus Set still returns
    # success, so the properties read back false and Qt's bridge publishes
    # nothing at all.
    #
    # Measured on a booted Rime desktop, 2026-09-18, with a private HOME (the
    # one rime-shell's tests/lib/headless.sh creates, which has no dconf
    # database):
    #
    #     dconf backend : Set IsEnabled <true> -> () ... GetAll -> false, false
    #     memory backend: Set IsEnabled <true> -> () ... GetAll -> true, true
    #
    # The failure mode is the dangerous one. An empty accessibility tree looks
    # exactly like a surface with no markup, so a suite built on the first line
    # reports "this surface publishes nothing" and is believed.
    #
    # Scoped to the launcher on purpose: it is the only process whose GSettings
    # backend these properties depend on, and the application under test keeps
    # whatever backend it would really have. The memory backend starts from the
    # schema default (false) and accepts the write, which is also strictly more
    # hermetic than reading — or writing — the dconf database of whoever is
    # logged in.
    #
    # It is a no-op where gsettings-desktop-schemas is absent, as in the bare

    # property to decide whether to pay for an accessibility tree at all. This
    # harness IS the assistive technology, so it does what one does.
    #
    # ── A correction, and the machine that produced the wrong answer ────────
    #
    # This block used to say the opposite, and said it with measurements:
    #
    #     org.a11y.Status.IsEnabled cannot be pushed false here at all. Setting
    #     it to <false> and reading it straight back returns <true> ... Qt 6.10.3
    #     publishes whenever it can REACH an a11y bus, with IsEnabled true or
    #     false. All four combinations register.
    #
    # Both observations were real and the conclusion was an artefact of ONE
    # laptop. On a developer machine with a live desktop session both properties
    # are ALREADY true before this harness starts, so "set false, read true" was
    # measuring a value that had never been false, and "Qt does not consult it"
    # was never tested against a flag that was genuinely off.
    #
    # Measured on a second machine -- a bare fedora:43 container, which is what
    # CI runs -- the same code gives the opposite result:
    #
    #     BEFORE: {'IsEnabled': <false>, 'ScreenReaderEnabled': <false>}
    #     the greeter registers NOTHING with the registry
    #     ... set both true, and the tree appears exactly as on the laptop.
    #
    # So Qt DOES gate on the status flags, they CAN be pushed in both
    # directions on a machine where nothing has already turned them on, and a
    # suite that relied on the old paragraph would have reported the greeter as
    # publishing no accessibility tree the moment it ran anywhere but here. That
    # is the second time in this unit that a second machine has corrected a
    # finding a laptop was certain of.
    #
    # Reachability is still the OTHER gate, and still the shipped greeter's
    # problem: an application with no D-Bus session bus cannot resolve
    # org.a11y.Bus and publishes nothing whatever these flags say. See
    # tests/test-rime-greet-session-bus.sh.
    #
    # QT_LINUX_ACCESSIBILITY_ALWAYS_ON is still deliberately NOT set. It forces
    # the bridge past every check including reachability, which would make this
    # harness pass on an image where accessibility genuinely cannot work. These
    # two properties are a different thing: they are the switch a screen reader
    # itself throws, on the bus, over the same interface any reader uses.
    #
    # Order matters and is load-bearing: this block sits BEFORE the
    # AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS export because tests/mutate-greet-atspi.sh's A7 splices
    # a broken session bus in at that export. With the block after it, A7 would

# application does -- resolve org.a11y.Bus on the session bus and ask it for the

# tell the two paths apart: the mutant that breaks the session bus SURVIVED,
# because the application under test still had a direct address to fall back on.
