// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Behavioural test for CompositorService — the §17 compositor adapter facade.
//
//     ./tests/run-compositor-facade-test.sh      (the live session)
//
// To exercise the labwc backend without rebooting into labwc, stage it and run
// it inside a nested one — the harness starts a filler toplevel, which this
// suite needs (see "the session precondition" below):
//
//     cp tests/compositor-facade-test.qml .facade.qml \
//       && ./tests/run-nested-labwc.sh .facade.qml 30; rm -f .facade.qml
//
// Exit status 0 = all assertions passed, 1 = at least one failed.
//
// ── This test runs against the LIVE compositor, so it never mutates it ───────
// It reads workspaces, windows and the focused title from whatever session is
// running it. It calls actions only where the capability under test is FALSE,
// to prove the refusal path, and those calls are no-ops by construction. It
// never focuses a workspace, moves a window, changes gaps, applies a shader,
// starts hyprsunset or enters a submap. A test suite that reconfigured the
// developer's desktop has happened here before and it is not happening again.
//
// What it proves:
//   1. A backend is selected and matches the detected compositor.
//   2. The capability map has exactly the schema keys and every value is a real
//      boolean, not an undefined that reads as false by accident.
//   3. An action whose capability is false returns false and spawns nothing.
//   4. Window and title tracking follow their backend's OWN refcount contract.
//   5. outputState()/inputState()/version() deliver a success and a failure
//      answer — the first two against stubs, so the result does not depend on
//      what this machine happens to have installed.
//
// ── What is backend-specific, and why that had to be said out loud ───────────
// This suite used to assert "windows are empty with no ref held" and "the title
// is the placeholder with no ref held" flatly, for every backend. Those encode
// HYPRLAND's refcount semantics as universal: Hyprland pays a `hyprctl` per
// refresh, so it genuinely starts empty and reverts when the last ref goes. On
// niri and labwc the same data arrives over a protocol the compositor pushes
// anyway, so both properties are live whether or not anyone asked — and those
// two assertions therefore FAILED there the moment a window existed, while
// "holding a windows ref produces a window list" failed if one did not. The two
// could not both pass, so the suite was Hyprland-only and did not admit it.
//
// So the assertions come in four kinds, and every one of them is labelled:
//
//   • Gated on CompositorService.windowsPolled / .titlePolled — the declared
//     cost model. Polled backends must empty on release; pushed backends must
//     already have the data before any ref is taken. Each branch asserts the
//     thing that would go red if the other contract were implemented.
//   • Gated on a capability (can.windows, can.workspaces, can.gaps, …). A
//     backend that cannot do something is asserted to say so, not skipped.
//   • The session precondition: at least one toplevel must exist, because
//     every window assertion below is empty-loop-vacuous without one. That is
//     a property of the SESSION and not of the facade — on the developer's
//     desktop it is whatever they had open; inside a nested labwc it is the
//     filler the harness starts. It is asserted rather than assumed, so an
//     empty session goes RED instead of passing over nothing.
//   • Backend-independent: the capability schema, the stub-driven state
//     contracts, and loading all four backend files.
