#  check-color-tokens.sh — colours come from the theme, or from this allowlist.
#
#  ── Why this check exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Outside src/theme/ the tree carried 66 lines of hardcoded hex, 71
#  occurrences. Counting only the ones that meant "something is wrong", there
#  were SEVEN different reds:
#
#      #f87171  12 sites   destructive controls, conflicts, offline
#      #f38ba8   4 sites   disk >=90%, update failed, urgency high
#      #ff4444   4 sites   battery <=5%, clear-bind hover, record dot
#      #e06c75   2 sites   notification critical
#      #ff5555   2 sites   timer urgent
#      #ff5c5c   2 sites   lockscreen auth error
#      #ff6b6b   2 sites   power menu danger
#
#  Nothing distinguished them. The same class of event rendered in a different
#  red depending on which file happened to draw it, and two surfaces reporting
#  the SAME event disagreed: a notification's accent bar changed colour as the
#  toast expired into the list, because the toast said #ABB2BF for normal
#  urgency and the list said Theme.active.
#
#  Every test passed throughout. A hex literal is valid QML; no check looked.
#  This is the colour half of the problem tests/check-scale-tokens.sh describes
#  for geometry, and it has the same shape — a local idiom that reproduces
#  itself, because the next person to add a red copies the red next to them.
#
#  ── Why an allowlist rather than a ban ──────────────────────────────────────
#  Some literals are correct and must survive. A modal scrim has to darken any
#  wallpaper, so it must NOT follow the palette. A swatch component's default
#  is a sentinel: a visible black chip means a caller forgot to pass a colour,
#  and a token there would hide the bug. Those are listed below WITH THE REASON,
#  which is the part that stops the next reader "fixing" them.
#
#  The count is asserted EXACTLY, and the allowlist is a set of (file, colour)
#  pairs rather than a per-file tally. Per-file tallies pass when someone swaps
#  #f87171 for #ff0000 in the same file, and this repository has shipped a
#  `-ge 30` assertion that stayed green while 20 of 68 items were dropped.
#  So: a NEW literal fails, a REMOVED one fails until it leaves the list, and a
#  SUBSTITUTED one fails. All three, or the list rots.
#
#  ── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  It bounds hex literals ("#rgb" .. "#aarrggbb") and the CSS colour NAMES in
#  the list below, in code position. It also bounds one specific disguise: a
#  colour written as Qt.rgba(248/255, 113/255, 113/255, a), which is a hex
#  literal in component fractions and drifts away from the token it duplicates
#  invisibly — exactly what happened to #f87171 at alpha 0.75 and 0.50.
#
#  That disguise was worth 45 occurrences of the Qt.rgba(n/255, n/255, n/255)
#  pattern, of which 43 became tokens and 2 are allowlisted below. (Counting is
#  by OCCURRENCE throughout this file. The hex layer was 66 lines / 71
#  occurrences / 75 once named colours are included — quote the basis, because
#  three different numbers are all correct for the same tree.)
#
#  It does NOT bound Qt.rgba() with plain decimals, e.g. Qt.rgba(0.9,0.2,0.2,1).
#  Those exist (CenterContent's recording fills) and are deliberately out of
#  scope; say so rather than let the header imply coverage it lacks.
#
#  Colours are extracted with a comment- and string-aware scanner, not a line
#  grep, so a hex named in a `//` or `/* */` comment can neither satisfy nor
#  trip this check. Five checks in this project have been satisfied by their
#  own prose; this one is self-tested against that in both directions.
#
#  PASS = the set of colour literals in code equals the allowlist, exactly.
#
#  Run from anywhere: ./tests/check-color-tokens.sh
#  Point it at another tree with RIME_COLOR_SRC=/path/to/src (used to prove it
#  fails on the code as it was before the tokens existed).

# ── The Agent Center's own rule (roadmap P0-021) ────────────────────────────
# The colour half of this file's problem had a second shape in src/services/
# agents/, and no literal was involved, so nothing above could see it. Both
# session rows decided a state's colour inline:
#
#     color: needsYou ? Theme.active
#          : state === "failed" ? Theme.wsUrgent
#          : live ? Theme.text : Theme.subtext
#
# Every colour there is a token, so the check passed. It is still wrong twice
# over. Seven runtime states collapse onto three values, two of which are the
# palette's FOREGROUND — on a matugen dark scheme `text` is #e3e2e5 — so
# starting, working, complete and exited all render near-white, which is
# precisely the bug a user reported as "Rime agents display only in white".
# And `wsUrgent` is a Workspace Visuals token: a fixed pink borrowed from the
# workspace strip, so the agent list's red moved whenever the workspace strip's
# did, for no reason either file stated.
#
# Both rows carried their own copy, and the copies had already begun to differ.
# So the rule is structural rather than about colour values: an agent row does
# not decide what a state looks like. src/services/agentstate.js does, once,
# and tests/agent-state-test.js measures the result.
#
# Two literals survive, and neither is a mapping — they are listed WITH THE
# REASON for the same purpose as the colour allowlist above.

# ── 5b. the ratchet on translucent white ────────────────────────────────────
#
# Qt.rgba(1, 1, 1, α) is not a hex literal in disguise, so section 5 does not
# see it — and it was harmless for as long as dark was the only palette the
# shell could reach. P0-021 made light reachable (WallpaperService passes
# matugen `-m`), and every one of these became a foreground that is invisible on
# a light surface. That is the single reason there is no Light/Dark control in
# Settings; Colors.qml carries the explanation next to the light values it
# blocks.
#
# A ceiling rather than a ban: 211 sites is not a thing to fix in one branch,
# and a check that fails today teaches everyone to skip it. It fails if the
# number goes UP, which is what keeps Colors.qml's comment true, and it fails if
# the number goes DOWN without EXPECT_WHITE_FG being lowered with it — so paying
# the debt down means saying so here, and light mode gets closer on purpose
# rather than by accident.
#
# 212 -> 211 when P0-018 landed on the integration branch beside P0-023. P0-018
# measured 212 on its own base; P0-023's settings rework had meanwhile folded
# two of CfgRow.qml's translucent whites into one conditional and removed two
# from KeybindsPage.qml, for a net -1. The ratchet is doing exactly what it was
# written to do — the debt went down and somebody had to say so here — and light
# mode is not reachable at 211 either.
#
# 211 -> 204 with the UI/UX roadmap's Phase 3: CfgButton, CfgTile and
# ProfileButton draw with the palette's roles (src/theme/roles.js, checked on
# all twelve shipped palettes) instead of translucent whites. Still not light-
# mode ready at 204.
#
# 204 -> 199 with Phase 16: CfgSwitch, CfgSegmented, CfgSlider, CfgTextField.
#
# 199 -> 0 with Phase 18: every remaining site is a palette role (text on its
# three roles, fills and borders as the palette's text at the same alpha), or,
# where the surface underneath is fixed rather than the palette's (a scrim over
# album art, a wallpaper thumbnail, an accent chip), an explicit fixed colour
# commented as such. Every surface tests/visual can open was captured in both
# matugen schemes of the default wallpaper. At 0 this is a ban: one new
