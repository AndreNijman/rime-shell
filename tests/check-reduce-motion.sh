#  check-reduce-motion.sh — every animation takes its timing from the motion
#  system, and Reduce Motion therefore reaches all of them.
#
#  ── History ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  This began (roadmap P2-003) as a measurement of how little of the shell the
#  Reduce Motion switch reached: 41 of 453 animation durations. The other 403
#  were integer literals written in place — `ColorAnimation { duration: 120 }` —
#  that no setting could touch, so a user who turned Reduce Motion on because
#  motion makes them ill still got 89 % of it.
#
#  The UI/UX roadmap v3 (Phase 1) replaced the one global `animDuration` with
#  theme/Motion.qml: semantic tokens (`Motion.hover`, `Motion.selection`,
#  `Motion.morphEnter` …) whose spatial members are 0 under Reduce Motion and
#  whose effect members are kept but shortened. This file is now the lint that
#  holds the tree to it (roadmap §3.6, "No new raw motion literals").
#
#  ── The rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1. A `duration:` is a Motion token, a Motion* animation type, or a local
#      property that resolves to one. The legacy `Theme.animDuration` family
#      still honours Reduce Motion and is counted separately, as a ratchet that
#      only goes down: it is the last of the old single duration.
#   2. A literal duration is allowed ONLY with an entry in ALLOW below, which
#      names the file, the value, and why a role cannot express it (a countdown
#      that must match a timer is not motion). Everything else fails.
#   3. `Motion.spatial(…)` / `Motion.effect(…)` with a literal argument outside
#      src/theme/ is a literal in disguise, and fails the same way.
#   4. Named Qt easings (`Easing.OutCubic`, `Easing.InOutCubic`, `Easing.OutBack`
#      …) are the old vocabulary; motion curves come from Motion. They are a
#      ratchet too. `Easing.Linear` (countdowns, spinners) and `Easing.InOutSine`
#      (the breathing of a loop) are not counted.
#   5. An infinite loop must be gated on `Motion.loops` or `Motion.ambient`, or
#      turning motion off leaves it running.
#
#  Counts are asserted EXACTLY, both directions: going up is the regression;
#  going down without editing the constant means the ratchet should be tightened
#  to lock the improvement in; the total moving means the scanner's idea of an
#  animation changed, and a scanner that quietly stops finding things is how an
#  exact count becomes a green light for nothing (check-color-tokens.sh's
#  EXPECT_WHITE_FG established this idiom).
#
#  ── Why the scanner is not a grep ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   * comments and strings: this tree documents its own animation decisions in
#     prose, and `// duration: 120` is not an animation.
#   * one level of indirection: `duration: root.animDuration` resolves through a
#     local property, so local properties are followed once.
#
#  It reads the source; it does not run the shell. tests/motion-test.js proves
#  the token table's policy (spatial → 0, effects capped) in node.
#
#  Run from the repository root.
