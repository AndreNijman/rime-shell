#  check-gaming-settings.sh — structural invariants for P1-049's Gaming page.
#
#  ── Why this exists, and why it must not skip ───────────────────────────────
#  The properties that make this page honest are properties of the SOURCE: it
#  runs nothing on a timer, it escalates for nothing, exactly one command it can
#  run changes anything, and it re-measures instead of trusting an exit code.
#  None of those is visible in a running session, and no CI runner has a
#  compositor, so a behavioural QML suite always skips there. A suite that skips
#  proves nothing, and this repository has already shipped assertions that
#  passed because they never ran.
#
#  Everything here is grep-able and runs headless. It never invokes `rime`:
#  `rime mode set` changes the machine it runs on, and a test suite that
#  switched the developer's power policy to run an assertion would be a worse
#  bug than any it could catch.
#
#  ── THE INVARIANT WORTH THE MOST ASSERTIONS ─────────────────────────────────
#  No timer. P1-049 asks for a master "optimise games automatically" control,
#  and `rime mode set --auto` is documented one-shot: "Rime ships nothing that
#  re-evaluates this on a timer." A poller in the shell would be this page
#  inventing the daemon the OS declined to ship, and it would do it invisibly —
#  the page would simply appear to work, while quietly overriding a mode the
#  user had set by hand. So: no Timer in either file, and the one command that
#  changes anything is reachable from exactly one function.
#
#  Run from the repository root.
