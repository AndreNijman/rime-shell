#  run-lockscreen-atspi.sh — the lock screen, read back over real AT-SPI, the
#  way a screen reader reads it (roadmap P2-003).
#
#  ── What this is for ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  tests/check-lockscreen-a11y.sh reads src/windows/Lockscreen.qml and asserts
#  the markup is there, on the right object, and cannot leak the password. It
#  says plainly, in its own header, that it does NOT run the lock screen and
#  read the tree back over AT-SPI. This is that missing half.
#
#  The difference is not academic. A screen reader never sees a QML file or a
#  QQuickItem: it connects to an accessibility bus and reads what Qt's AT-SPI
#  bridge chose to publish. The two trees differ in ways invisible from the QML
#  side — the bridge suppresses the name of any passwordEdit item, maps roles
#  into AT-SPI's own vocabulary, and drops items it judges uninteresting. The
#  only way to know what a blind user is told is to ask the bus.
#
#  ── What it found, and why the suite is shaped the way it is ────────────────
#
#  It asks the bus, and the bus says the shell publishes ONE node: itself.
#
#      root | role=application | name=quickshell | ChildCount=0
#
#  No window. No lock surface. No password field, no status line, no icons.
#
#  No quickshell window of ANY kind reached the tree in any configuration tried:
#  the whole shipped shell.qml, and a minimal config holding a FloatingWindow, a
#  PanelWindow and a plain Qt Quick Window. An `Accessible.*` binding in this
#  repository lives inside one of those, so on this evidence none of them is
#  reachable by an assistive technology at runtime — the markup is not wrong,
#  it has nowhere to go. Note what that does NOT say: run-a11y-controls-test.sh
#  and check-lockscreen-a11y.sh measure the QML side, and they are still true
#  about the QML side. What is new is that the QML side is where it stops.
#
#  Measured here on 2026-09-18, and narrowed rather than guessed at:
#
#    * quickshell DOES register with the accessibility registry. The bridge is
#      loaded, the bus is reachable, and the application node is published with
#      the right name — so this is not "accessibility is off".
#    * QT_LINUX_ACCESSIBILITY_ALWAYS_ON=1 changes nothing, so it is not the
#      org.a11y.Status gate either.
#    * The same harness, in the same run, on the same compositor and the same
#      bus, publishes a full three-node tree for a plain Qt Quick Window under
#      the stock `qml` runtime (tests/lockscreen-atspi-control.qml). That is §1
#      below and it is what makes the empty tree a measurement.
#    * A plain Qt Quick `Window` created INSIDE quickshell is equally absent,
#      so it is the process and not the window type.
#    * Under gdb, in the quickshell process: QGuiApplication::topLevelWindows()
#      has 2 entries, the first has type() == Qt::Window (1) — so it is neither
#      a Popup nor the Desktop, the two kinds Qt filters out — and
#      QQuickWindow::accessibleRoot() on it returns NULL. Qt's
#      QAccessibleApplication::childCount() is the size of topLevelObjects(),
#      which keeps only windows whose accessibleRoot() is non-null
#      (qtbase/src/gui/accessible/qaccessibleobject.cpp). A null accessibleRoot
#      on every window is therefore exactly a ChildCount of 0.
#    * The same gdb expressions, run against the CONTROL process in the same
#      way, answer SIZE 1 / TYPE 1 / accessibleRoot 0x5587847b8570. So the
#      instrument reports non-null when there is something to report, and the
#      null above is a fact about quickshell rather than about the probe.
#    * QAccessible::isActive() is 1 in BOTH processes, so the bridge is not
#      merely loaded in quickshell, it is active. The gate is not activation.
#
#  ANSWERED ON 2026-09-19, and the paragraph that used to sit here said this was
#  as far as the repository could take it. It was not. queryAccessibleInterface
#  returns null because Qt's accessibility FACTORY LIST IS EMPTY in this
#  process: QAccessible::installFactory registers a qAddPostRoutine that does
#  qAccessibleFactories()->clear(), post routines run from ~QCoreApplication,
#  qtdeclarative installs qQuickAccessibleFactory from a Q_CONSTRUCTOR_FUNCTION
#  that can only run once per library load, and quickshell destroys a
#  QCoreApplication immediately before constructing its QGuiApplication
#  (src/launch/main.cpp:127 and src/launch/launch.cpp:282). Reproduced in five
#  modes with no compositor and no bus by tests/check-quickshell-a11y-cause.sh,
#  which PINS it; confirmed inside the running shell, and the whole markup read
#  back off the bus once the factory is restored, by
#  tests/run-lockscreen-atspi-shim.sh.
#
#  None of that changes what THIS suite measures, and it deliberately does not
#  use the shim: the empty tree below is what a real screen reader gets on a
#  real machine today, and it stays pinned here until upstream is fixed.
#
#  ── So what does this suite assert? ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  It PINS the measurement, the way tests/test-rime-greet-atspi.sh in rime-os
#  pins Qt's refusal to publish the AT-SPI password role: as an equality, so
#  that the day the tree stops being empty this suite goes red and says so,
#  instead of staying quietly green through the fix.
#
#  And it does NOT count the assertions the card actually asked for — the
#  field's name, role and passwordEdit, the status line's live name, the two
#  icons' absence — as passes. Every one of them is satisfied by an empty tree.
#  "No node named Password" is true of a tree with no nodes; so is "no node
#  whose name contains a private-use codepoint". They are SKIPs here, with the
#  reason printed, because a SKIP is a could-not-run and never a pass. That
#  vacuity is the whole trap this unit has been caught by before.
#
#  ── The lock is engaged for real, on a compositor of this run's own ─────────
#
#  §3 flips LockState through the shipped IPC entry point and the shipped
#  WlSessionLock engages ext-session-lock on a private headless labwc. Nothing
#  here can touch the session of whoever is at the machine: tests/lib/headless.sh
#  aborts unless the socket it came up on is inside a runtime directory this run
#  created, and tests/lib/atspi.sh aborts unless the accessibility bus is too.
#
#  ── The logind guard is MEASURED before anything is locked ──────────────────
#
#  src/services/system/LockedHintService.qml reaches for `loginctl show-user`
#  and then `busctl --system … SetLockedHint`. On a developer's machine the
#  system bus is the real one, and rime-agentd polls LockedHint to decide
#  whether Remote Control keeps running and whether a root grant survives — so a
#  test that locked first and checked afterwards would be betting the machine on
#  a private XDG_RUNTIME_DIR being enough. §2 installs recording stubs for both
#  tools, asserts from the log that the chain stops at step 1, and asserts that
#  no SetLockedHint argv is ever produced. It runs BEFORE the lock, because
#  Lockscreen.qml's Component.onCompleted pushes the initial hint at startup and
#  that is a complete exercise of the chain.
#
#  Run from anywhere: ./tests/run-lockscreen-atspi.sh

# Each of these is trivially satisfiable by an empty tree, which is the exact
# shape of vacuous pass this unit has been caught by before. They are SKIPs with
# a reason attached, and the reason is printed once here rather than four times.
#
# They are NOT unmeasured any more, and this is the only place that says so:
# tests/run-lockscreen-atspi-shim.sh makes every one of them for real, by
# putting Qt's factory back inside the running shell with a test-only
# LD_PRELOAD. They stay SKIPs HERE on purpose. This suite measures what a screen
# reader gets on a real machine with nothing loaded into it, and turning these
# into passes on the strength of an instrument that does not ship would be the
# same lie in the other direction.

# ── Two things this suite deliberately does not claim ───────────────────────
#
#  * It does not claim the markup in Lockscreen.qml is wrong. It is right, and
#    tests/check-lockscreen-a11y.sh proves it against the source. It claims the
#    markup has nowhere to go.
#  * It does not claim a screen reader gets NOTHING from Rime. The greeter is a
#    separate process running the stock qml runtime, and rime-os's
#    tests/test-rime-greet-atspi.sh reads its tree back successfully. The login
#    screen is accessible; the desktop and the lock screen are not.
