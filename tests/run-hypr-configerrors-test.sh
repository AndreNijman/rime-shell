# P0-025: the Lua this shell generates has to load in the Hyprland Rime ships.
#
#     ./tests/run-hypr-configerrors-test.sh
#
# ── Headless, on nothing you can see ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# It used to nest Hyprland inside the session named by WAYLAND_DISPLAY, with a
# header asking whoever ran it to please use a spare machine. It now nests
# inside a HEADLESS labwc from tests/lib/headless.sh — Hyprland inside labwc
# inside a private runtime directory — so there is nothing to ask.
#
# That this works at all contradicts what the tree said. nav-geometry's header
# records "nested in a headless labwc: comes up" and then discards the recipe
# because the Hyprland it produces publishes no output and never asks its Qt
# client for another frame. True, and irrelevant here: `hyprctl configerrors`,
# `hyprctl reload` and `hyprctl version` all answer perfectly well on an
# instance with no output, because none of them draws anything. Measured on
# 0.56.2: signature published, configerrors clean, reload ok, monitors [].
#
# The one thing that DOES need an output is the shell that generates the Lua,
# so it runs on the host labwc — which has one — with
# HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE pointed at the nested Hyprland. The generator
# writes a file and calls `hyprctl reload`; neither needs to be a client of the
# compositor it is reloading. The "a real output" assertion the suite used to
# make is therefore replaced by one that proves the same thing without needing
# a monitor: the instance answers `hyprctl version` with its own version.
#
# ── What this proves, and what it does not ───────────────────────────────────
#
# The acceptance criterion is "hyprctl reload and hyprctl configerrors are clean
# after any generated change". configerrors needs a RUNNING Hyprland, so this
# starts one — nested, with its own HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE, its own
# XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and its own HOME — and asks that instance, by signature, never
# the ambient one.
#
# It covers the module this repository generates, rime/shell-keybinds.lua,
# loaded through the same absent-tolerant loader the seeded hyprland.lua uses.
# It does not cover the rime-os modules beside it; those ship from another
# repository and are verified there.
#
# ── Never the developer's session ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# hyprctl with no -i talks to the newest instance it can find, which on a
# Hyprland desktop is the one the developer is looking at. So:
#
#   1. Every hyprctl call here passes -i "$sig", and $sig is read from the
#      runtime directory this script created, by diffing against what was there
#      before it started Hyprland.
#   2. The script refuses to run if that signature matches the ambient
#      HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE. A nested instance that somehow came up as
#      the host is a bug, and reloading it would be reloading the desk.
#   3. The generator runs with HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE set to the nested
#      one, so KeybindService's own `hyprctl reload` — which takes no -i,
#      because in a real session there is only one — reaches the nested
#      instance and nothing else.
#   4. HOME is a sandbox, so every file written is inside it.
#
# ── Two compositors, and why ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Hyprland 0.56.2 will not start on its own headless backend on a machine with a
# GPU and no DRM master: AQ_BACKENDS=headless dies in CBackend::create(). It
# does come up nested in another Wayland compositor, and that compositor does
# not have to be one anybody can see — a labwc on WLR_BACKENDS=headless is
# enough. The host labwc must NOT be on the pixman renderer: aquamarine asks it
# for a dmabuf, a software-rendered host has none to give, and the only symptom
# is CBackend::create() failing with nothing else said.
