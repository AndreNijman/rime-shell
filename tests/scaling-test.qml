// brings its own headless compositor, its own HOME and — when it can — TWO
// outputs of different densities.
//
// ── What changed, and why the old version could not fail ────────────────────
//
// This file used to carry a `bucket()` function that re-implemented Metrics'
// breakpoint table, and seven assertions comparing that copy to its own
// literals. Moving the 1440p breakpoint from 1600 to 1500 in Metrics.qml left
// the suite at 25 passed, 0 failed. The table is now theme/scaling.js, both the
// shell and tests/scaling-test.js read it, and the arithmetic is asserted
// there. What is left here is what only a running session can answer: what the
// shell resolves on the outputs it was actually given.
//
// The critical property is unchanged: scale is 1.0 on a 1080p/1200p panel. The
// whole token set was calibrated on one, so any change here must be a NO-OP
// there.
