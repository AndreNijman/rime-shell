#  run-rtl-test.sh — right-to-left layout, measured (roadmap P2-004, "RTL").
#
#  ── The row this closes, and the claim it replaces ──────────────────────────
#
#  The ledger carried "RTL: fonts present, the image cannot render it" from
#  round 1 to round 19. Round 20 ran it and it is FALSE: through the real
#  engine, Arabic ا falls out of the hardcoded JetBrains Mono to DejaVu Sans
#  Mono, Hebrew א to DejaVu Sans, Thai ก to Droid Sans Thai and Devanagari अ to
#  Droid Sans Devanagari — four image-owned rpms. The image renders all of them.
#
#  What was actually missing is LAYOUT. Before this suite there were zero
#  `LayoutMirroring` and zero `layoutDirection` in the whole of src/, so a
#  reader of any of those scripts got a settings row whose label sat on the
#  opposite side from the side they read from. That is the whole of the row and
#  it is what is measured here.
#
#  ── Three questions, and only one of them is about the shell ────────────────
#
#  1. Does Qt's layout direction follow the locale ON THIS IMAGE? The image
#     installs `glibc-langpack-en` only, so the answer was not obvious and is
#     not assumed: the same fixture is run twice, once with the locale scrubbed
#     and once under LANG=ar_EG.UTF-8, and the two are required to DISAGREE.
#     A single run that says "RightToLeft" proves nothing — it could say that
#     whatever the environment is.
#  2. Does the ENGINE mirror? The control for question 3: a bare Item with a
#     left-anchored child must move when mirrored, or the runner's Qt does not
#     implement this and every verdict is about the toolkit.
#  3. Does the SHIPPED settings row mirror? Instantiated, mirrored, and the
#     positions read off the live objects.
#
#  ── What this deliberately does NOT claim ───────────────────────────────────
#
#  Mirroring acts on anchors and positioners. It cannot touch an explicit `x:`,
#  and it does not reach anything the shell paints inside a PanelWindow, because
#  those roots do not declare it yet. Both are PINNED here, exactly and in both
#  directions, so the remaining half is a number somebody can watch rather than
#  a sentence somebody can forget. A suite that reported "RTL: done" over a
#  mirrored settings page and an unmirrored bar would be worse than no suite.
#
#  ── Four outcomes, not three (round 32) ────────────────────────────────────
#
#  PASS / FAIL / SKIP / CANTRUN. The last one is new and it is the reason this
#  suite stopped being permanently red on the Arch CI runner without anything
#  being swept under a skip. SKIP means the machine is simply not the thing
#  (not a booted Rime host, so a documented default is probed instead).
#  CANTRUN means a NAMED, MEASURED precondition came back false and the reason
#  is printed on the line. Section 1's three direction rows are the only ones
#  gated that way, the gate is switched off entirely on a booted Rime host, and
#  it cannot engage on a machine where the direction flipped anyway — so an
#  excuse whose own reason has stopped being true goes red instead of quiet.
#
#  Section 2's right-to-left pass names the ROUTE that supplied its direction
#  in every line it prints: "theme" (what Rime ships) or "preload" (a machine
#  that had to be handed libKF6I18n, which the CI runner does). They are
#  different claims and the suite must never print the same green for both.
#
#  Headless: -platform offscreen, WAYLAND_DISPLAY removed from the environment.

    # ── THE PRECONDITION. Measured round 31, made load-bearing round 32. ─────
    #
    # This block sits ABOVE the three rows it gates, and that is the whole
    # point of round 32. Those three rows require a right-to-left APPLICATION
    # direction, and whether a machine can produce one at all is a property of
    # its qt6ct build, not of Rime. Measuring that first is the difference
    # between "Rime's right-to-left layout is broken" and "this machine has no
    # process that loads the Qt catalogue" — two claims the suite used to print
    # with the same three red lines.
    #
    # This suite has said since round 23 that "the platform theme supplies the
    # right-to-left direction", and the pair above does isolate the theme —
    # but only as a CARRIER. The theme's plugin does not load a catalogue at
    # all. Four runs, one process each, `strace -e openat` naming every
    # `qt_*.qm` opened, on Qt 6.10.3 with LANG=LC_ALL=ar_EG.UTF-8:
    #
    #   QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct  -> RTL, opened qt_ar.qm and qt_en.qm
    #   a bogus theme name          -> LTR, opened none
    #   no platform theme           -> LTR, opened none
    #   no theme + LD_PRELOAD of
    #     libKF6I18n.so.6           -> RTL, opened qt_ar.qm and qt_en.qm
    #
    # The last one settles it: with NO platform theme, merely loading KF6's
    # i18n library into the process installs the Qt catalogue and flips the
    # direction. `nm -DC` and `strings` on Fedora's libqt6ct.so find no
    # QTranslator code in the plugin itself; `ldd` finds eight KF6 libraries
    # behind it, because Fedora ships a post-release git snapshot
    # (qt6ct-0.11-13.20250907git23a985f) built with the KDE integration.
    #
    # That is also why this section was RED on the GitHub Arch runner from the
    # day it landed until round 32. Arch ships upstream release qt6ct 0.11-8,
    # read out of run 35384106245's own log; the runner has 64 qt_*.qm
    # including qt_ar.qm and `QLocale calls ar_EG right-to-left` PASSES there.
    # Nothing is missing except a process that loads the catalogue.
    #
    # Round 32 did two separate things about that, and they answer two
    # different questions. The GATE below turns those three reds into named
    # could-not-runs on a machine whose theme measurably carries no loader —
    # that is about the RUNNER. And ci.yml now installs `ki18n` there, which
    # lets the suite take the "preload" route in section 2 — that is about
    # Rime, and it is the half worth having: the shipped row is now measured
    # under a real right-to-left direction on Arch and Qt 6.11.2 as well as on
    # Fedora and Qt 6.10.3. Do not let the two collapse into one sentence.
    #
    # So the row below is an IF AND ONLY IF, and it is the assertion that tells
    # the two machines apart instead of leaving one of them unexplained. It can
    # fail in both directions, and the self-test under it proves the predicate
    # is capable of answering NO.

# ── and the thing mirroring can NEVER do ────────────────────────────────────
#
# LayoutMirroring resolves anchors and reverses positioners. An explicit `x:` is
# a number and stays a number, so every one of these sites is outside its reach
# by construction — the same shape as check-reduce-motion.sh's "402 are bare int
# literals no switch can touch". Round 22 counted them and asserted
# `[ "$x_sites" -ge 0 ]`, which is true of every integer; that is the gate that
# inspects nothing, and this replaces it.
#
# The pin is the SET, not the count, because the count is what hides a swap: one
# site fixed and one added reads as no change. Each entry below was read and
# bucketed by hand, and the bucket is the reason it is allowed to stay:
#
#   NOT AN ITEM'S X AT ALL (4) — mirroring must not touch these and could not.
#     TopBar.qml            x2  `Region` entries in the input mask, not visuals
#     LabwcBackend.qml      x1  a JavaScript object literal, a geometry record
#     NiriService.qml       x1  the same literal, in the niri backend
#
#   WIDTH-COMPENSATED (0) — an arithmetic no-op when mirrored. Appearance's,
#   Data's and Misc's six `x: 10; width: parent.width - 20` blocks and
#   KeybindsPage's two full-bleed `x: 0; width: root.width` were here; UI/UX
#   Phase 17 put the first on the content edge (plain full width) and anchored
#   the second on CfgScroll's banner line, so the bucket is empty.
#
#   GEOMETRY PLUMBING (0) — ArchMenu's mask proxy (`x: 0`) went with UI/UX
#   Phase 10: its input region is the spill body's bounds now.
#
# What is NOT on this list is the point: the three sites that were a bare left
# inset with an intrinsic or asymmetric width — CfgScroll's lifecycle banner
# (x:2 against a 12px right inset, inside the component that declares the
# mirroring), and MiscPage's About row and Update button — are now anchored, and
# a new one anywhere in src/ fails this.
