#  run-settings-controls-test.sh — press the shared settings controls, for real
#  (roadmap P0-024, criteria 1 and 2).
#
#  ── Why not the quickshell harness ──────────────────────────────────────────
#  tests/run-settings-pages-test.sh builds the ten real pages under quickshell
#  and asks each one what it is. It cannot press anything: quickshell offers no
#  way to post an input event. qmltestrunner does — QtTest's mouseClick and
#  keyClick post real QMouseEvent and QKeyEvent into the QQuickWindow,
#  hit-tested by position, which is the same delivery path a compositor's input
#  takes — and cannot load a page, because every page reaches a singleton that
#  needs Quickshell.
#
#  So this is the same recipe run-slider-wheel-test.sh established for P0-020,
#  pointed at the commit bar, the lifecycle line and the ordinary controls
#  instead of at the wheel.
#
#  It is Qt's own test module rather than a new framework, and the interface
#  here is the one every other check in this directory has: skip cleanly when a
#  dependency is missing, print PASS/FAIL lines, end with `passed=N failed=M`.
#
#  ── Why the staging dance ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Every Cfg component says `import "../../"` to reach the Theme singleton, and
#  Theme reaches Metrics and ColorLoader, which need Quickshell — a screen list
#  and a FileView that plain qmltestrunner has no way to provide. So this script
#  copies the real src/components/config next to a Theme stub answering the
#  members those components read. The components under test are the shipped
#  files, byte for byte; only the palette they paint with is fake, and no
#  assertion here looks at a colour.
#
#  Headless: -platform offscreen, so this opens nothing on anybody's desktop.
#
#  Run from anywhere: ./tests/run-settings-controls-test.sh
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
