#  run-a11y-controls-test.sh — what a screen reader and a keyboard-only user
#  get from the shared settings controls (roadmap P2-003).
#
#  ── What was measured before this existed ───────────────────────────────────
#
#  Zero `Accessible.` usages across 209 QML files. No FocusScope, no
#  KeyNavigation, and exactly one real `activeFocusOnTab` in the whole shell
#  (CfgSlider). 166 MouseArea and 28 TapHandler against that one tab stop.
#  Eleven Settings pages and the nav pane were reachable only with a mouse, and
#  a reader landing on any control in them found an unnamed element.
#
#  The repair is in the shared controls rather than in the pages: 294 of this
#  tree's 671 user-facing labels are in config_tab/pages, and naming each
#  control at its call site would both be 294 edits and rot the first time
#  somebody changed a label without changing its twin. CfgRow already holds the
#  words — it hands them to whatever control was placed in it.
#
#  ── Why qmltestrunner and not the quickshell harness ────────────────────────
#
#  tests/run-settings-pages-test.sh builds the real pages under quickshell and
#  asks each one what it is. It cannot press anything: quickshell offers no way
#  to post an input event. QtTest does — keyClick posts a real QKeyEvent into
#  the QQuickWindow through the same delivery agent a compositor's input takes —
#  and cannot load a page, because every page reaches a singleton that needs
#  Quickshell. So this is the recipe run-slider-wheel-test.sh established for
#  P0-020 and run-settings-controls-test.sh reused for P0-024, pointed at
#  accessibility.
#
#  ── Why the staging dance ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Every Cfg component says `import "../../"` to reach the Theme singleton, and
#  Theme reaches Metrics and ColorLoader, which need Quickshell — a screen list
#  and a FileView that plain qmltestrunner cannot provide. So the real
#  src/components/config is copied next to a Theme stub answering the members
#  those components read. The components under test are the shipped files, byte
#  for byte, and no assertion in here looks at a colour.
#
#  Headless: -platform offscreen, so this opens nothing on anybody's desktop.
#
#  Run from anywhere: ./tests/run-a11y-controls-test.sh
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
