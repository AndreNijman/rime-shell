#  run-i18n-host-test.sh — the host CAN install a QTranslator, and here is the
#  artefact that does it (roadmap P2-004, internationalisation baseline).
#
#  ── What this closes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  tests/run-i18n-test.sh proves the translation PIPELINE end to end — the
#  strings are marked, lupdate extracts them, lrelease compiles them, and a
#  running QML engine substitutes German. Its section 4 then says why none of
#  that reaches a user: the shell runs inside quickshell, quickshell builds a
#  bare QQmlEngine, and nothing in the process ever calls installTranslator. No
#  QML can fix that, because QTranslator is a C++ class and not a QML type.
#
#  The conclusion drawn from it for thirty rounds — that the fix is therefore
#  somebody else's — is one step too far. A bare QQmlEngine still resolves QML
#  modules off its import path; a QML module may carry a compiled plugin; and a
#  compiled plugin runs C++ inside the shell's own process while the import is
#  being resolved, which is before a single binding has been evaluated. So the
#  host change is a module Rime ships and shell.qml imports.
#
#  tests/rime-i18n-plugin.cpp is that module. This suite builds it and measures
#  it in two hosts: a bare QQmlEngine assembled out of quickshell's own two
#  lines (tests/rime-i18n-host.cpp), and, where one exists, the REAL
#  /usr/bin/quickshell running the SHIPPED AgentHelpContent singleton.
#
#  ── Why a second host at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  The GitHub Arch runner has no quickshell — it is an AUR package there — so a
#  suite that could only measure this in situ would measure NOTHING on the
#  machine the gate runs on, and would sit green for ever saying so. The bare
#  engine runs anywhere Qt 6 does, and section 3 is the half the runner
#  executes. Section 4 is the half that only a machine with quickshell can run,
#  and it refuses BY NAME rather than skipping quietly.
#
#  ── Why "the strings changed" is not enough on its own ──────────────────────
#
#  Five runs, not two, because "German appeared" has at least three innocent
#  explanations and each needs its own control:
#
#    plain  no plugin at all               English, and NO plugin log line —
#                                          so the plugin is genuinely absent
#                                          and not merely quiet
#    plugin plugin + catalogue             German
#    nocat  plugin, catalogue dir EMPTY    English, and the plugin says so —
#                                          so the German came from a CATALOGUE
#                                          and not from the plugin's presence
#    late   translator installed AFTER     English — a translator installed
#           the tree exists                after evaluation changes nothing
#    late-retranslate  …plus retranslate() German — and the ONLY difference
#                                          from `late` is that one call
#
#  The last pair is why the plugin does its work from initializeEngine(). It is
#  measured rather than asserted because it is the fact a later "just install a
#  translator in main()" would break on, silently.
#
#  ── Titles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Every assertion goes through chk(), which takes its title ONCE and prints the
#  same words whether it passes or fails. Round 31 lost four rows to a suite
#  that called one assertion by two names depending on the outcome (FOUND 29);
#  a mutation harness cannot verify a target it cannot find. Here the drift is
#  structurally impossible rather than gated after the fact.
#
#  ── Headless discipline ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Nothing here needs a compositor: the platform is offscreen and the probe
#  creates no window. Every launch carries `env -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY -u DISPLAY
#  -u HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` so a machine with a live session cannot have
#  a window land on it, and this file never reads $WAYLAND_DISPLAY at all.
