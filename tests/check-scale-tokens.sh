#  check-scale-tokens.sh — geometry uses Theme.px(), text uses Theme.fs().
#
#  ── Why this check exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Theme exposes two scalers and they are NOT interchangeable:
#
#      px(v) = Math.round(v * scale)
#      fs(v) = Math.max(7, Math.round(v * scale))     <- legibility floor
#
#  The floor exists because text below about 7px is illegible at any DPI. It is
#  correct for a font size and wrong for everything else, because it silently
#  CLAMPS every small geometric value up to 7.
#
#  This was not hypothetical. The Agent Center was built using `Theme.fs()` for
#  radius, spacing, margins and heights — 42 call sites. Sixteen of them were
#  under the floor, so on screen:
#
#      spacing: Theme.fs(2)   rendered as 7px   (3.5x too loose)
#      spacing: Theme.fs(3)   rendered as 7px
#      leftMargin: Theme.fs(4) rendered as 7px  (nearly 2x)
#      radius: Theme.fs(3)    rendered as 7px   (more than 2x too round)
#
#  The result was a tab whose spacing rhythm and corner radii matched nothing
#  else in the shell — reported by the developer as "the agent tab didn't match
#  rime shell at all". Every unit test passed throughout: nothing was broken,
#  the wrong function was simply being called, and no check looked.
#
#  It also spread. When a later change added a remote-agents section, it copied
#  the surrounding idiom and introduced twelve more.  A wrong local convention
#  reproduces itself, which is the argument for a check rather than a fix.
#
#  ── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  It does not care about the numbers, only about which scaler wraps them, and
#  it says nothing about a literal — `radius: 8` is a separate question this
#  check deliberately leaves alone.
#
#  PASS = no geometric property is wrapped in Theme.fs(), and no font size is
#         wrapped in Theme.px().
#
#  Run from anywhere: ./tests/check-scale-tokens.sh
