#  run-recovery-atspi-shim.sh — read the RECOVERY screen back over real AT-SPI,
#  and DRIVE it the way a screen reader would (roadmap P2-003).
#
#  ── What this answers that tests/check-recovery-a11y.sh cannot ──────────────
#
#  That suite reads the source and asks whether the two rules the markup has to
#  follow are still followed. This one asks whether the markup ARRIVES, and
#  then whether a reader can actually complete the most consequential flow on
#  the page using nothing but the accessibility bus.
#
#  It is the same instrument as tests/run-lockscreen-atspi-shim.sh: quickshell
#  destroys a QCoreApplication before constructing its QGuiApplication, which
#  clears Qt's accessibility factory list for the life of the process, so the
#  shell publishes exactly one node until tests/quickshell-a11y-shim.cpp puts
#  the factory back from inside. tests/check-quickshell-a11y-cause.sh is the
#  standalone proof of that cause and needs no compositor at all.
#
#  ── The control is INSIDE the run ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  §4 reads the tree back BEFORE the shim installs anything and requires
#  exactly one node: the defect, re-measured in this very run, on this very
#  compositor, with these very buses. Everything after it is therefore
#  attributable to the factory install and to nothing else.
#
#  ── The machine it interrogates is a stub, and the stub RECORDS ─────────────
#
#  `rime recover status --json`, `rime doctor --json` and the reset dry run are
#  answered from fixtures captured from a real `rime` (the same payloads
#  tests/recovery-test.js carries), so every string this suite asserts is one
#  it chose rather than whatever this machine happens to be today. The stub
#  also appends its argv to a log, and that log is what makes the destructive
#  half checkable in both directions:
#
#    * press the Erase button over the bus BEFORE the loss list exists and NO
#      `--commit` may appear;
#    * press it after, and the exact argv — including the confirm token the
#      plan printed — MUST appear.
#
#  The second is the load-bearing one. Until 2026-09-19 it was impossible: the
#  service acknowledged the loss list one line before the phase allowed it and
#  `commitReady` was false for ever, so the factory reset could not be
#  completed by anybody. That is what pressing this button over AT-SPI found.
#
#  ── What it does NOT claim ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Not that the shell is accessible. It is not: the factory is put back by an
#  LD_PRELOAD that exists only in this test tree, and on a real machine a
#  screen reader still gets one node from the shell. What it claims is that the
#  markup on this page is correct all the way to the bus and that the flows are
#  completable through it, so the whole remaining defect is the upstream one.
#
#  Read the totals line, never the tick: this suite exits 0 on a skip.

#
#     ok   … the Erase button reports NO states at all — a reader is told it is unavailable
#     FAIL … the Erase button reports itself unavailable
#
# — one row with two names. Nothing about that is visible in a diff, and
# everything that keys on the assertion breaks: a mutation harness verifies a
# mutant's target against the `ok` wording and then looks for it in the `FAIL`
# wording, finds nothing, and scores MISSCORED — a real defect reported as a
# broken expectation. A human diffing two runs loses the row the same way.
#
# So: every `bad` title must be a substring of some `ok` or `nope` title. That
# is the exact property the harness depends on, stated once, checked here.
