# ── Why this exists next to the behavioural test ─────────────────────────────
# run-compositor-facade-test.sh needs a Wayland session and skips on CI, which
# has none. A suite that skips is a suite that proves nothing, and this repo has
# already shipped assertions that passed because they never ran. Everything here
# is grep-able and runs headless, so the adapter layer has real CI coverage even
# though no runner has a compositor.
#
# It checks the properties a typo would break and a reviewer would not notice:
# that all four backends declare exactly the same capabilities, that the facade
# agrees with them, and that Hyprland's import stays inside Hyprland's backend.

# ── The hyprctl boundary ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 5.2's actual finish line: `hyprctl` is spawned from ONE directory. Everything
# else asks CompositorService, which refuses where the capability is false
# rather than spawning a doomed process — the failure mode that had a shell on
# sway polling `hyprctl -j activeworkspace` every four seconds forever.
#
# This is a boundary and not a ban. Two files outside the adapter still spawn
# it, each for a stated reason, and each is ASSERTED to still need it: an
# allowlist entry that outlives its file's migration silently re-permits
# something already fixed, which is how allowlists rot into decoration.
#
# Matching is command-shaped rather than "contains the word". Half of this
# shell's prose is about what it used to spawn, and the Display page's own
# error text reads "…nor hyprctl is available." — a check that fails on its own
# documentation is a check somebody deletes. So `hyprctl` has to be the FIRST
# WORD of a command: at the start of a line, or right after a quote, a pipe, a
# semicolon, an `&&`, a `(` or an `exec`. Comment lines are dropped too.
HYPRCTL_ALLOWED=(
    # `hyprctl binds -j` (the capture-conflict cache) and `hyprctl reload`.
    # Keybind generation is 5.3, not 5.2, and there is nothing to migrate these
    # onto: `binds` has no analogue anywhere else — labwc's bindings are
    # generated into rc.xml by rime-labwc-keybinds and niri live-reloads its
    # own config — so a capability here would wrap a one-backend feature in a
    # one-backend capability and answer false everywhere it was asked.
