#  check-headless-runners.sh — no suite in here may open a window on the
#  display it inherited.
#
#  ── Why this check exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Twelve runners in tests/ started quickshell, a compositor, or the whole shell
#  on whatever WAYLAND_DISPLAY they inherited. On a build box that is nothing.
#  On the machine somebody is working at, it is a window — or twenty windows, or
#  a second compositor — landing on top of them, and run-nested-labwc.sh said so
#  in its own first line: "nested inside the current Wayland session".
#
#  The repair was tests/lib/headless.sh. This file is the part that keeps the
#  repair. A runner that CAN reach the ambient display eventually does: someone
#  adds a suite by copying the one next to it, and if the one next to it fell
#  back to the inherited display on a machine with no compositor, so does the
#  copy. The fallback is the bug. Nothing here is advisory.
#
#  ── It checks the invariant, not the library ────────────────────────────────
#  "Did you source lib/headless.sh" would be the easy check and the wrong one.
#  Eight suites — run-nav-geometry-test.sh, run-settings-pages-test.sh,
#  run-settings-staged-test.sh, run-agent-settings-test.sh,
#  run-agent-state-render-test.sh, run-input-settings-test.sh,
#  run-display-unplug-test.sh and run-display-transaction-test.sh — were
#  already correct before the library existed and bring their own headless
#  compositor inline. They pass here on their own merits, and a future runner
#  that does something smarter than the library must be able to as well. Each
#  is named in its own assertion below, so a rule that came to recognise only
#  lib/headless.sh could not quietly stop checking them.
#
#  ── The four rules ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  Applied to comment-, quote- and heredoc-stripped source, in file order,
#  because order is the whole point: a neutralisation after the launch it was
#  meant to protect is decoration.
#
#    A. Every launch of a graphical client is covered one of two ways. Either
#       the script has already unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY out of its own environment
#       (a bare `unset`, or `headless_begin`, or the
#       `headless_require_nested_optin` gate, which exits instead), or the
#       launch itself carries the neutralisation — `env -u WAYLAND_DISPLAY …`,
#       or a `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=…` prefix naming a socket the script made.
#
#    B. Nothing reads $WAYLAND_DISPLAY before neutralising it. Before the unset
#       that variable IS the ambient session, so reading it is reaching for the
#       desk even when the value is only used to decide whether to skip. This
#       is the rule that catches the old
#       `[[ -z "${WAYLAND_DISPLAY:-}" ]] && SKIP` opening, which is how a
#       runner concludes it may use somebody's session.
#
#    C. Outside tests/lib/, nothing names HEADLESS_AMBIENT_DISPLAY,
#       HEADLESS_AMBIENT_RUNTIME or HEADLESS_AMBIENT_SIG. The library records
#       those so it can REFUSE; a runner reading one is asking for the value the
#       refusal exists to keep away from it.
#
#    D. Nothing supplies a fallback for WAYLAND_DISPLAY, or writes a display
#       name into it. `${WAYLAND_DISPLAY:-wayland-1}` after the unset satisfies
#       A, B and C — the launch is covered, the read is not early, no ambient
#       variable is named — and still lands the run on wayland-1, which on this
#       machine is somebody's session. Rule D was added because that exact
#       mutation was written by hand against run-popup-smoke.sh and the first
#       three rules passed it. Suites behind `headless_require_nested_optin`
#       are exempt: consulting the session they nest in is the whole of what
#       the gate asks permission for.
#
#  Rule A is why the scan has to be quote- and heredoc-aware rather than a
#  grep. tests/check-compositor-backends.sh contains the line
#  `COMPOSITORS=(hyprland niri labwc)` and check-keybind-lua.sh the string
#  "the Hyprland artifact is …". Neither launches anything. A grep for the word
#  flags both, and a check with two standing false positives is one somebody
#  turns off.
#
#  ── What it does NOT do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#  It reads the source; it does not run it. A script that computes a compositor
#  name at runtime and execs it through a variable is invisible here, and so is
#  one that reaches the session through a helper this repository does not own.
#  The rules bound the mistake this tree has made twelve times — a client
#  started on an inherited WAYLAND_DISPLAY — and claiming more than that would
#  be the same overreach the header of check-color-tokens.sh warns about.
#
#  Run from the repository root.
