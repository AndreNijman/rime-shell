#  run-lockscreen-atspi-shim.sh — read the LOCK SCREEN's accessibility markup
#  back over real AT-SPI, with Qt's accessibility factory put back.
#
#  ── Why this suite exists, and why it is separate ───────────────────────────
#
#  tests/run-lockscreen-atspi.sh measures the DEFECT and pins it: the running
#  shell publishes exactly ONE node to the accessibility bus, its own
#  application node, so its §5 read-back assertions are recorded as SKIPs — an
#  empty tree satisfies every one of them vacuously, and a vacuous pass is the
#  failure mode this unit has been caught by before.
#
#  tests/check-quickshell-a11y-cause.sh names WHY, in a program with no
#  compositor and no bus: ~QCoreApplication runs a post routine that CLEARS
#  Qt's accessibility factory list, qtdeclarative installs its factory from a
#  Q_CONSTRUCTOR_FUNCTION that can only run once per library load, and
#  quickshell destroys a QCoreApplication immediately before constructing its
#  QGuiApplication.
#
#  This suite is the third thing, and it is the one the roadmap actually asked
#  for: with tests/quickshell-a11y-shim.cpp restoring that factory inside the
#  running process, the shipped markup DOES reach the bus, and the assertions
#  §5 could only skip become assertions that can fail. It is a separate file
#  rather than a §6 because it answers a different question — "is the markup
#  right" instead of "can the markup be seen" — and because the pin in the
#  other suite must keep measuring the unmodified shell.
#
#  ── The control is INSIDE the run, and that is the whole design ─────────────
#
#  §4 reads the tree back BEFORE the shim installs anything and requires
#  exactly one node: the defect, re-measured in this very run, on this very
#  compositor, with these very buses. §6's tree is therefore attributable to
#  the factory install and to nothing else — not to a bus that came up late,
#  not to a lock that engaged this time, not to a machine that behaves
#  differently. The shim waits for a FILE rather than a delay so that the
#  order of those two reads can never be a race.
#
#  ── What it does NOT claim ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  Not that the shell is accessible. It is not: nothing here is shipped, the
#  factory is put back by an LD_PRELOAD that exists only in this test tree, and
#  on a real machine a screen reader still gets one node. What it claims is
#  that the markup in src/windows/Lockscreen.qml is correct all the way to the
#  bus, so the whole remaining defect is the upstream one — and that when
#  upstream is fixed there is nothing else to write.
#
#  Read the totals line, never the tick: this suite exits 0 on a skip.

# ── wait for the STARTUP hint chain to finish before asking for a lock ──────

# chain is in flight only updated _desired — and _failed() used to clear _busy
# and return, where _succeeded() re-pumps. The newer request was then never
# acted on: the lock engaged, the surface came up, and logind was never told.
# Lockscreen.qml's Component.onCompleted starts exactly such a chain at
# startup, and on this private runtime directory it always fails at step 1.
#
# Measured here before this wait existed: the lock-acknowledged assertion went
# red on 2 runs in 9 while the lock had in fact engaged — §6 read the whole
# lock surface back in those same runs. tests/run-lockscreen-atspi.sh does not
# see it because its §2 waits for that warning as an assertion of its own, and
# so closes the race by accident. This closed it on purpose.
#

# mid-chain is a NEWER one that has never been tried rather than the step that
# just failed, which is still deliberately not retried. This run lives entirely
# in the window where that mattered: the loginctl stub exits 0 with no stdout,
# so step 1 always fails and `_confirmed` never leaves `undefined`, which is
# the only state in which the drop was observable at all.
