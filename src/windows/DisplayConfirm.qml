// ─── DisplayConfirm ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The Keep / Put it back question that follows every temporary display apply.
//
// WHY THIS IS A WINDOW AND NOT PART OF THE DISPLAY PAGE
//
// It used to be a section at the top of the Display settings page, and that is
// the bug behind P0-018: the user pressed Apply and no confirmation ever
// appeared, so the layout they wanted was reverted fifteen seconds later.
//
// Three separate reasons, all of them the same mistake — the question was
// parented to a surface the apply itself could take away:
//
//   The Config tab is a popup.  PopupDismiss closes every popup on
//   CompositorService.focusMoved, whose Hyprland source is `workspace`,
//   `activespecial`, `openwindow` and `focusedmon` — and a monitor
//   reconfiguration moves workspaces between outputs, so it can raise two of
//   those. Inferred from the event list rather than watched on hardware; the
//   two below were checked directly.
//
//   The Nexus window scrolls.  Apply is at the bottom of the page and the
//   confirmation was at the top, which is off screen at the moment it appears.
//
//   Both are one-per-output.  shell.qml builds them from Quickshell.screens, so
//   an apply that disables the output the settings window is on destroys the
//   window. Disabling an output really does remove it from Quickshell.screens —
//   checked against a headless wlroots session, not assumed.
//
// So: a layer-shell overlay of its own, built for EVERY output the same way
// ConfirmDialog is, driven by a singleton's countdown. One
// instance dying with its output leaves the others up, which is what
// "reachable after the layout changed" has to mean.
//
// The one instance that takes the keyboard is chosen by
// DisplayService.confirmScreen — an output this apply is not turning off.

    // ── This output's sizes (P1-040) ─────────────────────────────────────────
    // Not Theme's. Theme carries ONE factor for the whole shell — the reference
    // output's — so on a desk whose monitors have different densities it is
    // wrong for at least one of them. This modal is built per output (shell.qml
    // creates one from Quickshell.screens), it is anchored to nothing but its
    // own screen, and nothing outside it reads its size, so it can answer for
    // itself instead.
    //
    // `root.screen` is exact from construction — measured on quickshell 0.3.1
    // with two headless outputs of different densities, each PanelWindow's
    // screen.height is that output's height at t=0, before the surface is
    // mapped. No transient, so no first-frame resize.
    //
    // Colours stay on Theme deliberately: a palette belongs to the shell, not
    // to an output. Sizes come from `theme`, colours from `Theme`, and the
    // split is visible at every call site below.
    // The set is SHARED, not built here. theme/OutputScale keeps one ThemeSet
    // per factor the breakpoint table can answer — five objects for the whole
    // shell — because a token set is a pure function of its factor and a
    // hundred migrated files each constructing their own would build a hundred
    // copies of the same forty bindings onto SettingsService.
