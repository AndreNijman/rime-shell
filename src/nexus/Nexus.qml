// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Nexus — the standalone settings window.
//
// Settings previously existed only as a tab inside the dashboard, which meant
// they shared the dashboard's lifetime and its dismissal rules: click anywhere
// outside and the settings vanished, and any compositor focus change closed
// them. That is correct behaviour for a popup and wrong for a window you edit
// configuration in.
//
// So this is a real window. It has keyboard focus, it survives clicks elsewhere,
// it closes on Escape or its own close button, and it is opened over IPC:
//
//     rime shell nexus            (or: nexus <page>)
//
// Its body — navigation, header and page stack — is SettingsHost, the one host
// of the PageRegistry pages since UI/UX Phase 19 removed the dashboard's Config
// tab (a second host of every page, with its own staged state).
//
// One instance per screen, following the dashboard's pattern; NexusState.
// screenName decides which one is live, so the window opens on the output the
// user is actually looking at instead of always the primary.
//
// ── NOTCH_EXTRUDE (2026-09-27, replacing the drip) ──────────────────────────
// It comes out of the centre notch (Andre: "make the nexus actually flow in
// / liquid in from the top notch, becoming the window it is now"). The first
// version DRIPPED — a drop fell on a thread and inflated into the window —
// and read as "notch → teardrop → balloon → Nexus": a string holding a
// balloon, a giant round blob, then a rectangle, and on the way out the
// window shrank into a blob with its controls still readable. So it
// EXTRUDES now: the notch's bottom sags on the first frame, a broad neck
// comes down with a bulb on it, the bulb deepens and then widens — a flask
// flaring all the way down from the neck, never the window at 60 % — and
// becomes the window, and the neck thins and draws back into the notch. The
// content arrives once the silhouette is established, the navigation and
// title a beat before the page. Closing is not that backwards: the content
// goes at once, the window's top centre pinches up into a broad neck, and
// the mass is drawn up it into the notch. Three springs (SurfaceLifecycle,
// liquid), as every surface: the extrusion leads, the spread follows it, the
// neck trails.
//
// It is drawn as a FIELD (shapes/fluid/FluidDrop, geometry.js
// notchExtrudeField): round primitives smooth-unioned per pixel, so every
// join is a meniscus and every tip is round. The card's rim and its shadow
// arrive once the neck has drawn back — a shadow under a shape that is still
// pouring would be the wrong shape. Under Reduce Motion the card is simply
// there and fades, as before. Its window's lifetime is the lifecycle's
// `mapped` — completion, not a timer.
