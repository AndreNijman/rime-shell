// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PageRegistry — the single definition of the shell's settings pages.
//
// Settings are presented in one place: Nexus, through SettingsHost (UI/UX
// Phase 19). There used to be two — the dashboard's Config tab as well — and
// before this registry the dashboard tab hardcoded its own tab list AND its own
// five Loaders, so adding a page meant editing two lists. A page is declared
// once — id, title, icon, and the Component that renders it — and the host and
// the suites (settings-staged, nav-geometry) all read it from here.
//
// `group` is the navigation's section (UI/UX Phase 19b): the pages are listed
// in group order, and NavPane draws a section label above the first page of
// each group. Seventeen pages in one flat column read as a pile; five groups — what
// it looks like, how you drive it, who may reach what, the devices paired to it,
// and the machine itself — read as a map.
//
// `needsScreen` marks pages that consume refcounted telemetry services and must
// therefore be told whether they are genuinely on screen (see ServiceRef). Data
// & Storage and Misc do; getting it wrong on a new page means a poller that
// never stops, so it is declared rather than inferred.
