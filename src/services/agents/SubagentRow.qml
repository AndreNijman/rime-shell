// One thing a session started: a Claude subagent, or a process it forked
// (roadmap P1-020).
//
// Drawn under its session's row and indented, because that is the whole point
// — until this existed, an agent with six subagents working and an agent
// sitting idle were the same single row saying "working".
//
// ── WHY IT DOES NOT REUSE StateBadge ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// StateBadge draws one of the seven runtime states, and a child has none of
// them. It has `started` and possibly `ended`, and what it is doing is a
// conclusion drawn from those two and from whether its session is still alive.
// Giving a child a badge would mean inventing a state to put in it, which is
// the exact thing agentgraph.js exists to avoid: a status field is a claim
// that was true when it was written, and a subagent whose stop event never
// arrived would go on claiming it was working forever.
//
// So the mark here is a dot, not a badge, and its colour comes from the
// derived word rather than from a stored state.
//
// ── THE FOUR WORDS ARE FOUR DIFFERENT FACTS ─────────────────────────────────
//
//   running                  open, and its session is alive
//   finished                 the agent published subagent_stop for it
//   ended with the turn      the turn ended while it was still open
//   ended with the session   the session's process is gone
//   unknown                  open under a session that has exited
//
// Only "finished" is a subagent that finished. The middle two are the runtime
// saying it can no longer tell — a subagent CAN outlive the turn that started
// it — and painting those in the success tone would be a small lie repeated on
// every row. They get the muted foreground instead, which is what "no news"
// looks like everywhere else on this page.
