import "../agentstate.js" as AgentState

// The one place an agent's state becomes something you can see.
//
// Local sessions and remote ones both draw this, so a working agent on the
// desktop and a working agent on this laptop look identical — they are the same
// fact about the world, and the two rows had already drifted into two copies of
// the same ternary before this component existed.
//
// ── WHAT IT DRAWS, AND WHY THAT AND NOT JUST A COLOUR ───────────────────────
//
// A chip, a glyph, and — for the two states you must not miss — a fill. The
// mapping from state to tone, token and weight is agentstate.js's; the long
// argument for it lives there. What is here is only the drawing:
//
//   solid     the tone as a fill, glyph in whichever of the fixed-contrast
//             foregrounds actually reads on it. Reserved for `blocked` and
//             `failed`, the two states that mean somebody has to do something.
//   tint      the tone at 0.18, glyph in the tone. `working`.
//   outline   a ring in the tone, nothing filled. `waiting` — present, not
//             shouting.
//   plain     no chip. `done` and `idle`; a finished session is not a status.
//
// The weight is the point. Hue alone cannot separate `failed` from `done` for a
// red-green colourblind reader, and those are the two that matter most; shape
// and ink do it without depending on the eye. Which weight goes where was
// decided by simulation rather than by taste — see agentstate.js.
//
// `toneColor` is exposed because the row draws a stripe in it. That stripe is
// the reason the page reads as coloured at a glance rather than as a list of
// white text with one small badge on each line.
