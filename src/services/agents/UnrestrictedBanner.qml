// The indicator §42.1 criterion 9 asks for: something visible, wherever agents
// are, for as long as Always Unrestricted is on.
//
// ── ONE COMPONENT, TWO SURFACES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is drawn in the Agent Center, above the session list, and on the settings
// page that owns the switch. Two copies of the sentence would have been two
// sentences within a week, and this one has to stay exact: it names what the
// setting removed, and it must not imply anything it did not.
//
// Both surfaces bind `visible` to the same AgentPolicyService property the
// toggle does, so the banner cannot outlive the setting or lag behind it.
//
// ── WHY NOT THE BAR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The top bar is shared chrome, and a persistent red mark there is a decision
// about the whole shell rather than about agents. The Agent Center is where a
// user looks to find out what agents are doing, and the settings page is where
// they are standing when they change it — the two places the fact is load-
// bearing. If §42.1 later wants it in the bar, the copy is already in one file.
