// One agent session in the Agent Center.
//
// §3 asks for project, process, elapsed time and high-level state, and for a
// click to focus the existing terminal. That last one is the reason this row is
// a button and not a label: the row IS the navigation.
//
// The controls are deliberately few. Pause, resume and kill are here because
// they are lifecycle operations the runtime owns and no terminal offers. Diff,
// undo and checkpoint are NOT here — they change a project's contents, and a
// destructive action behind one unconfirmed click in a status list is how
// people lose work. Those stay in the CLI where `rime agent undo` asks first.
//
// ── THE THREE PLACES THE STATE IS VISIBLE ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A badge, a stripe down the left edge, and the state word itself, all in the
// one tone StateBadge resolves. Three because one was not enough: a single
// glyph in a 22px column, on a row whose every other pixel is the palette's
// foreground, is a page that reads as white — which is how P0-021 was reported.
// The stripe is what makes the LIST look like a status list from across the
// desk, before anything has been read.
//
// ── THE SANDBOX CHIP, AND WHY IT IS READ FROM THE SESSION ───────────────────
//
// §42.1 criterion 8: a running session displays its actual mode, and changing
// the default does not lie about sessions already running. `sandboxMode` reads
// this session's own record — the daemon flattens the six dimensions it
// normalised at fork time onto `SessionInfo` — and AgentPolicyService, which
// knows what a NEW session would get, is deliberately not consulted here. A
// row that read the setting would relabel four running agents the instant
// somebody moved a toggle, and every one of those labels would be wrong.
//
// Only the unconfined mode gets a colour. `project` is the default and `strict`
// is tighter still, and a status list that shouts about its own normal state
// teaches people to stop reading it.
//
// ── DIMENSION 1, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS FIELD IS THE WRONG ONE ─────────────────
//
// §4.1 criterion 3 asks that the agent-native permission mode be visible here.
// The obvious field is `session.native`, and it is the wrong one: it says what
// Rime did, and for the case that matters Rime did nothing. Andre runs Claude
// in `bypassPermissions` as his profile default, §4.1 says Rime must not
// override that, so `native` reads `inherit` — and a chip showing "inherit"
// beside a session running with confirmations off satisfies the criterion's
// words and answers none of its question.
//
// So the agent's own report wins. Claude puts `permission_mode` on every hook
// payload, rime-agentd records it as `native_observed`, and
// `Policy.sessionNativeLabel` prefers it. The chip then reads
// `project · bypassPermissions`, which is Claude's own word for its own mode.
//
// ── THE BREAK-GLASS INDICATOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// §3.4 asks for a "prominent red Agent Center indicator" and for "revocation
// control always visible". Those are one thing here: an indicator that says
// what is happening and how long is left, and a control beside it that ends it.
// It is drawn only for §4.5 break-glass — the mode that clears no_new_privs —
// and NOT for §4.4's session grant, which keeps every kernel boundary and is
// not what the sentence is about. Two red things would make neither red.
//
// ── THE SECOND LAYER, AND THE ONE ANSWER IT REFUSES TO GIVE (P1-020) ────────
//
// A session is not one thing. It delegates to subagents and it forks MCP
// servers, language servers and whatever a tool call runs, and until the
// runtime grew `SessionInfo.children` this row could not tell an agent with
// six subagents working from one sitting idle.
//
// The summary sits in the meta line and the detail is one click away, because
// the page is a supervisor: "what is running" belongs on the surface and
// "which of them" belongs behind an expander.
//
// The refusal is `Graph.supported()`. A daemon that predates the graph writes
// no `children` key at all, and every daemon in the shipped image is one of
// those — so the row draws NOTHING rather than "0 subagents", which would be a
// confident answer on the only machine anybody is running. Absent is not
// empty, and this row is where the difference is visible.
