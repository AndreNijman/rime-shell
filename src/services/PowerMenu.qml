// Power menu — vertical list of power action buttons.
//
// Rows (UI/UX roadmap v3 Phase 17, brief §F.6): 40 px, no gaps, the glyph in
// a fixed column so the labels line up — they used to be centred and padded
// with trailing spaces to fake it — and the state layer on hover instead of
// flooding the row with the accent. A destructive row tints toward danger. Each
// row is a RimePressable, so the menu is reachable with Tab and operable with
// Space/Return; it was pointer-only.

    // Windows is offered ONLY when a bootable Windows actually exists.

    // different ways: on a Linux-only machine it advertised an OS that is not
    // there, and on a machine where Windows was removed but its EFI boot entry was
    // left behind (which is what Windows does when its partition is deleted) it
    // offered to reboot into a loader that no longer exists.
    //
    // The privileged helper answers that question properly — it resolves the boot
    // entry's ESP and confirms the Windows loader is present, rather than trusting
    // the entry's existence — so the decision is delegated to it via --check rather
    // than guessed at here. --check never touches NVRAM and never reboots.
    //
    // Failure closed: no helper, no sudoers rule, or a non-zero exit all leave this
    // false and the row simply absent. A shell running on a distro that ships no
    // helper therefore hides the button instead of showing a broken one.

    // session does not exist. Advertising a button that logs you out and then
    // cannot start anything would be worse than not showing it.
    //

    // to select) AND the switch helper (so the choice can be recorded). Failure
    // closed: anything unexpected leaves this false and the row absent.

    // THE THIRD TEST IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING. This used to check the helper
    // and the session file only, never gamescope — but gamescope and Steam are
    // on-demand packages, not image content, so rime-gaming.desktop ships on
    // every machine while the binary it runs does not. The entry itself says so
    // and carries `TryExec=/usr/bin/gamescope` for exactly that reason, and
    // rime-greet's enumeration honours it.
    //
    // So the menu and the greeter disagreed. The menu offered "Gaming Mode" on
    // any Rime install; taking it logged the user out into a greeter that HID
    // the session, landing them back on the desktop with
    // `last-session=rime-gaming` recorded — which then selected by sort order
    // at the next login. The build gate in Containerfile.rime asserts the
    // greeter hides it; nothing asserted that this menu agrees.

    // resolves to nothing all leave the row absent.
