// Config → Firewall  (roadmap P1-044)
//
// Rime drops incoming connections by default. That is the right default and
// also the kind of change a user meets as a symptom rather than as a setting:
// a phone that stops casting, a printer that stops being found, a game that
// will not stream. A firewall a user cannot see is a firewall they disable at
// the first confusing symptom, so this page says what is dropped, what is
// open, and what they can open.
//
// ── WHY IT ONLY READS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `rime firewall allow` needs root. The shell's route to root is polkit, and
// P0-016 is the roadmap item where that stops being guesswork. Until then the
// page shows the command rather than running it — the same choice RecoveryPage
// makes for rollback, and for the same reason: a button that raises an
// authentication dialog nobody has tested is worse than a line of text that
// works when pasted.
//
// So the lifecycle is `live` and not `staged`: there is nothing held here. What
// the page shows is what the machine says, and the one thing it can be wrong
// about is named on the page — the unit being active is what it reads, and
// someone with root can flush the ruleset behind it.
