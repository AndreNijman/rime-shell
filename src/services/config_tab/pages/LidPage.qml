// Config → Closing the Lid. Roadmap P1-063.
//
// Andre asked for this in his own words:
//
//   "if i close my laptop lid without shutting down, most things pause to save
//    battery, but all agents and whatever theyre using/doing or whatever can
//    stay running, also staying with the vpn — like if i close my laptop at
//    school and codex is running (which needs vpn to work) it keeps working."
//
// ── The page this deliberately is not ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious version is a single switch labelled "Keep working with the lid
// closed". It is wrong in the direction that loses somebody's work: it implies
// the machine will do what the switch says, and on this laptop, today, it very
// often will not — and for a reason that has nothing to do with the switch.
// logind consults `HandleLidSwitchDocked` (default `ignore`) BEFORE it consults
// any inhibitor, so an external display makes the lid do nothing at all,
// whatever this page says and whether or not Rime is running. An owner who
// unplugs their monitor at school and finds the machine asleep would have been
// told "on" by that switch every time they looked.
//
// So the page LEADS with what logind will do, before anything it can change,
// and gives three answers where a switch gives two: it acts on the lid, it will
// not act on the lid, or that could not be established. The third is not "yes".
//
// ── Every input, because "why" was a criterion ───────────────────────────────
//
// Criterion 6 is "the owner can see why the machine did what it did". That is
// not one sentence: the decision comes from the lid switch, live agent
// sessions, a temperature, a charge and a pin, and any of the five can be the
// reason. All five are listed with what they read, so the answer to "why is it
// going to suspend" is on the page rather than in a journal.
//
// ── What this page is allowed to do ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read-only except for the pin. `rime lid status --json` and `rime lid report
// --json` write nothing. `rime lid pin` writes the owner's own
// ~/.config/rime/lid.toml and needs no privilege: the inhibitor it controls is
// `allow_active=yes` for an ordinary session, measured three ways. There is no
// `sudo` and no `pkexec` on this surface and no polkit prompt can come from it.
// See LidService's header.
//
// Nothing here suspends the machine, and nothing here can. The driver does
// that, as root, and this is a window onto it.
