// Config → Paired devices  (roadmap P1-051, criteria 3 and 5)
//
//   3. "Lost devices can be revoked from Rime Settings."
//   5. "Paired-device list shows name, last seen, permissions, and revocation
//       state."
//
// ── A revoked device stays on the list ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The daemon keeps the record after revocation so the listing can still show
// that it WAS revoked and when, and this page shows it. A row that vanished
// would leave the person unable to tell "I revoked that phone" from "that
// phone was never here" — and the second reading is the one that sends
// somebody hunting for a device they already dealt with.
//
// ── The biometric flag is a claim, and is not a column ──────────────────────
//
// Criterion 5 says "permissions", and the field behind it is
// `requires_user_verification`. It records that the DEVICE said its key is
// held behind a biometric or device lock. This desktop cannot see a
// fingerprint and cannot check it, which rime-remote-core says at length:
// "recorded as a requirement the owner set and not as a fact about the
// device".
//
// So it is one sentence under the list, exactly as `rime remote devices`
// prints it, and deliberately NOT a tick in each row — "a tick in a table
// would read as a fact this machine had verified". remotepairing.js exposes it
// only as that sentence, and tests/remote-pairing-test.js asserts the absence
// of anything a row could render per device.
//
// ── State colours are not decided here ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The token and the weight come from remotepairing.js, looked up on Theme by
// name. That is the rule tests/check-color-tokens.sh states after "Rime agents
// display only in white": a row does not decide what a state looks like, and a
// three-branch ternary made of theme tokens is still the bug.
