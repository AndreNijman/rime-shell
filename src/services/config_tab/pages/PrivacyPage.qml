// Config → Privacy & Permissions. Roadmap P1-061.
//
// ── The page this deliberately is not ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious version has one column of application names, one column of
// capability names, and a tick. It is wrong in the direction that gets somebody
// hurt: a tick beside "Camera" for a native binary reads as a claim that
// unticking it would stop the camera, and nothing on this system would.
//
// The second-most-obvious version fixes that by splitting the world into
// sandboxed and unsandboxed, and is also wrong. `io.github.cosmic_utils.camera`
// is a Flatpak whose manifest says `devices=all`: the host /dev is inside its
// sandbox, it opens /dev/video0 directly, the portal never sees the request,
// and its camera access is enforced by exactly what a native binary's is — the
// ACL logind writes on the device node. And there is no microphone portal in
// any version of xdg-desktop-portal, so no Flatpak's microphone is brokered
// either.
//
// So every row here carries the answer AND the enforcer, never one without the
// other, and there is NO CONTROL AT ALL on a row nothing can revoke. Not a
// disabled switch — a disabled switch invites the owner to wonder what is
// broken about their machine, where a sentence tells them the truth, which is
// that nothing on this system can do what they are asking for.
//
// ── Ordering ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Rows are ordered by enforcer strength rather than alphabetically, so that
// everything the machine actually controls sits above everything it merely
// observes. The sort lives in permissions.js, where the node suite can assert
// it.
//
// ── What this page is allowed to do ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Read-only by default. `rime permissions list --json` writes nothing and
// raises no authentication prompt. A revocation runs only on an explicit
// press, writes to the user's own permission store or override file, and needs
// no root — so this page raises no polkit prompt either. See
// PermissionsService's header.
