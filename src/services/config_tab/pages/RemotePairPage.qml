// Config → Pair a device  (roadmap P1-051, criterion 1)
//
// "Desktop can display a QR code / short pairing flow from Rime Shell."
//
// ── Why this page is where the QR lives ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// `rime remote pair` deliberately refuses to draw one in a terminal, and says
// why in its own source: "no encoder is vendored, and a wrong QR is worse than
// none — a phone scans it, fails, and the person concludes their camera is
// broken." It prints the payload and points here. This is the here.
//
// ── A code is minted, not read ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every other settings page of this shape asks questions on a timer. This one
// cannot: `rime remote pair` mints a ONE-TIME token and arms the daemon for
// the next device presenting it. Minting on a sweep would burn a token every
// interval, and each new one invalidates the code the person is at that moment
// holding their phone up to.
//
// So `ensureCode()` on becoming visible, and the button, and nothing else.
// Coming back to the page while a code is still good shows the same code
// rather than replacing it. An offer expiring is deliberately NOT a third
// trigger — see the service's header on why arming this machine every three
// minutes for a page somebody walked away from is the wrong trade.
// tests/run-remote-pairing-page-test.sh asserts the whole rule against the
// stub's call log: zero `pair` calls before the page is shown, exactly one
// after, still one after leaving and returning, two after asking.
//
// ── No code is a first-class state, not an empty frame ──────────────────────
//
// When there is no offer the page says why, in the words the command used, and
// draws NOTHING where the code would be. Not a placeholder, not a greyed
// square, not a stale code with a note. A QR-shaped thing that is not a
// scannable current offer produces exactly the failure the feature is built to
// avoid, and "the code expired" and "the service is not running" are different
// problems a person has to be able to tell apart.
