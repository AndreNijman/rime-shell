// Config → Gaming  (roadmap P1-049, "understandable toggles")
//
// ── THE STATE THIS PAGE IS DESIGNED FOR ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not installed. Steam, gamescope and the overlay are on-demand `rime install`
// packages; a fresh Rime image has none of them, and the machine this page was
// written against had none of them. A Gaming page whose first screen is a row
// of switches would be offering to configure software that is not there, so the
// first thing here is what is missing and the one command that fixes it.
//
// The command is TEXT. Installing needs root, and this page raises no
// authentication prompt — the same rule BlueprintService follows for
// `sudo rime apply`, for the same reason: `rime` can report across a privilege
// boundary it cannot cross, and a button here that ran sudo would throw that
// away.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS NO "OPTIMISE AUTOMATICALLY" SWITCH ──────────────────────────
//
// P1-049 asks for one. `rime mode set --auto` is documented one-shot — "Rime
// ships nothing that re-evaluates this on a timer", and `rime workload` says it
// again — so a switch with that label would promise a daemon that deliberately
// does not exist, and would keep promising it every time the user looked at the
// page. What is offered instead is the choice itself, with the mode the machine
// is actually in read back underneath it. A switch that lies is worse than a
// button that is honest about being a button.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT HERE YET, AND WHY ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Criterion 2 also names VRR, background-update suppression and per-game
// profiles. `rime game profile` exists and the other two have no verb at all.
// None of the three is stubbed with a control that does nothing: a switch whose
// backend is missing reads exactly like one whose backend is broken, and this
// page would rather be short than pretend.
CfgScroll {
    id: root

    // Criterion 1 of P0-023. Live: pressing a control here changes the machine
    // now, and there is nothing to save afterwards — the mode is derived from
    // what the daemon reports rather than written to a file.
