// Pure logic behind P1-049's Gaming settings page: reading `rime gaming --json`,
// reading `rime mode status`, and deciding what the page is allowed to claim.
//
// Kept out of the QML so tests/gaming-settings-test.js can exercise it under
// Node — the same file the shell loads, not a copy of it. Nothing here spawns a
// process or touches a file. No CI runner has a compositor, so a behavioural QML
// suite always skips there and a suite that skips proves nothing; this module is
// the half that can be proved anywhere.
//
// ── THE ONE THING THIS PAGE MUST NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Promise automation the OS refuses to perform. `rime mode set --auto` is
// documented one-shot — "Rime ships nothing that re-evaluates this on a timer",
// and `rime workload` repeats it — so a switch labelled "optimise games
// automatically" would describe a daemon that deliberately does not exist. The
// honest shape is an ACTION the user presses and a readout of the mode they are
// actually in, which is why this module exposes no "auto" boolean at all.
//
// ── AND THE ONE IT MUST NOT ASSUME ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// That the tools are installed. Steam, gamescope and mangoapp are on-demand
// `rime install` packages and are absent from a fresh image; on the machine this
// was written against, all three were missing. `rime gaming --json` already
// reports each one with the reason it is looking, so the page reads that rather
// than probing PATH itself: a second opinion about what is installed is how a
// page starts disagreeing with the session launcher that actually fails.

// not a sentence anybody can act on. The key is the CLI's; the words are for
// the reader. A check the CLI reports and this list does not name still shows
// up — see otherChecks() — so adding a probe on the OS side cannot silently
// vanish from the page.
