// ─── NiriBackend ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// CompositorService's niri adapter. Almost all of the state comes from
// NiriService, which was already a complete niri IPC client before this facade
// existed: one socket, one EventStream request, and no polling at all — the
// initial burst of events *is* the state fetch.
//
// So this file is deliberately thin. It maps NiriService's model into the shape
// CompositorService publishes and owns the action verbs, which NiriService did
// not have beyond focusWorkspace. Duplicating the event handling here to make
// the backend look substantial would mean two clients on one socket.
//
// Actions go out through `niri msg action`, not the socket. The socket carries
// an event stream that this shell must not interleave requests into, and the CLI
// is niri's own supported entry point for one-shot actions.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
