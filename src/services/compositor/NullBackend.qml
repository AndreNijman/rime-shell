// ─── NullBackend ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The backend for "running under something Rime has no adapter for" — sway,
// river, KDE Wayland, GNOME, a nested session, anything.
//
// It is also the schema. Every other backend in this directory answers exactly
// these properties and functions; this file is what a reviewer reads to see the
// shape, and what the CI invariant compares the others against.
//
// The important behaviour is that everything is false and every action is a
// no-op. The old default was to assume Hyprland when detection failed, and that
// is how a shell on sway ended up polling `hyprctl -j activeworkspace` every
// four seconds forever and appending include lines to a Hyprland config that
// was not there. Unknown means off.
