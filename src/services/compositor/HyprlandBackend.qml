// ─── HyprlandBackend ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// CompositorService's Hyprland adapter. Loaded by URL and only on Hyprland, so
// `import Quickshell.Hyprland` above never resolves anywhere else — which is the
// whole reason the consumers no longer need `target: isHyprland ? Hyprland : null`
// scattered through them. Resolving that singleton is what constructs it, and
// constructing it off Hyprland logs.
//
// ── Two dialects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Hyprland can be configured in its own .conf format or, with the Lua plugin, in
// Lua. Dispatch syntax differs between them and ShellState.configProvider says
// which one this machine uses. Every dispatch in this file goes through
// _dispatch()/_keyword() so the branch exists once rather than at nine call
// sites, which is how the Lua path drifted last time.
//
// ── What costs something ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Workspaces and the focused monitor are pushed by the Quickshell.Hyprland
// singleton and cost nothing. Window enumeration and the focused window title
// need `hyprctl`, so both are refcounted: CompositorService pushes windowsWanted
// and titleWanted in, and nothing spawns while nobody is looking.
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    // ── What counts as "the user is now looking somewhere else" ───────────────
    // The raw events that mean focus actually moved. `activewindow` is
    // deliberately absent: Hyprland fires it for title changes too, so a
    // browser switching tabs would count as the user looking elsewhere.
    //
    // `focusedmon` IS included, and that is a decision rather than an
    // oversight, because it has a visible cost. Hyprland's `follow_mouse` is on
    // by default, so on a multi-monitor session merely moving the cursor across
    // a monitor boundary now fires this and PopupDismiss closes every open
    // popup. It did not before. Single-monitor sessions — this shell's usual
    // case — are unaffected, because the event never fires there.
    //
    // It is kept because CompositorService defines focusMoved as "a different
    // workspace, a different window, a different monitor", and the other two
    // backends already honour the monitor half: niri fires on
    // focusedWorkspaceId (which changes when monitor focus does, since each
    // output shows its own workspace) and labwc on activeToplevelChanged.
    // Dropping it here would make Hyprland the one backend that silently
    // narrows the contract it is implementing, and `Popups.closeAll()` is
    // global — the popup sits on the monitor the user just left.
    //
    // `activemonitor` used to be in this list and was never an event. Hyprland's
    // IPC event names are compiled into the binary; `focusedmon` and
    // `focusedmonv2` are there, and the only occurrence of "activemonitor"
    // anywhere in it is `workspace.activemonitor`, a Lua hook name — checked

    //   ICC calibration curve is loaded into that same LUT, so on the wlroots
    //   compositors night light and a calibration curve are the same slot and
    //   the second one to write wins. On Hyprland they are two slots and both
    //   survive — which is the case a creator machine cares about.

    // So the mechanism is per compositor and the reason is colour management,
    // not the absence of an alternative.
