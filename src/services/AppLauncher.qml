// AppLauncher — Rime Search: one text field over apps, files, settings,
// windows, clipboard, calculator, commands, projects, agents, SSH hosts and
// package search (roadmap §15).
//
// Lives inside Dashboard.qml on the "launcher" page. Dashboard is a PanelWindow
// with WlrKeyboardFocus.Exclusive, so TextInput receives keys without extra
// wiring.
//
// This file is the SURFACE. It ranks nothing, decides nothing about what may
// run, and builds no command line. Every one of those lives in
// src/services/search.js, driven through SearchService — because no CI runner
// has a compositor, and a launcher with system reach cannot have its safety
// rules in a QML binding that nothing checks.
//
// ── "?" is unchanged, and that is deliberate ────────────────────────────────
// A query starting with "?" is an ANSWER query: evaluated locally when it is
// plain arithmetic and otherwise sent to Wolfram|Alpha. It is the one thing
// here that leaves the machine, and it stays exactly as it was — including
// `_usedWolfram`, which gates every reference to the singleton so a plain
// search never instantiates it, never reads its credential file and never
// resets it. Search.parseQuery routes "?" to a scope every provider gate
// refuses, and manifest.js's launcherWantsProviders() already refused it for
// plugins, so no provider of either kind can put a row where the answer goes.
//
// ── Plugin rows (roadmap §16, the launcher-provider extension point) ────────
// `providers` below hosts every granted launcher-provider plugin. Its rows are
// APPENDED to the ranked built-in results, never merged into the ranking: the
// shell's rows first, then plugin rows in provider order. A plugin adds to this
// list and cannot reorder it. Provider rows carry `kind: "plugin"` and are
// handled at the TOP of activate(), before the branches that run a DesktopEntry
// or hand an Exec string to `bash -c`.
//
// ── THE PREVIEW, WHICH IS THE POINT OF §15's FOURTH BULLET ──────────────────
//
// "Actions should have clear permissions and previews before destructive system
// changes."
//
// Every row carries a class from search.js's ACTIONS table — safe, changes, or
// destructive — and the class is a property of the action, never of the row, so
// a provider cannot label a reboot safe.
//
//   * A non-safe row is visibly different before it is read: a coloured badge
//     with the class and the privilege it needs, and its own glyph.
//   * Enter on a non-safe row opens the preview. It does not run it. The
//     preview shows what the action does, what privilege it needs, whether it
//     can be undone, and THE EXACT ARGV — for a package it also runs
//     `rime resolve`, which is read-only and needs no root.
//   * Committing needs a different gesture: Ctrl+Enter, or the Run control
//     inside the preview. A held Enter cannot repeat through both stages,
//     because the second stage is not Enter.
//   * Ctrl+Enter straight from the list, with no preview open, does nothing.
//     Search.commitDecision() requires the previewed row and the selected row
//     to be the same non-empty row, which is the clause that makes the preview
//     mandatory rather than merely available.
