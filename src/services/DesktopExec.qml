// DesktopExec — launch a DesktopEntry the way its own file asked to be launched.
//
// ── The defect this exists for ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// /usr/share/applications/nvim.desktop ships from the neovim rpm on every Rime
// image and declares `Terminal=true`. `rime install neovim` refuses it — and is
// right to: files/system/libexec/rime-pkg skips a package whose exact NEVRA the
// image already provides, so an overlay can never shadow the image's copy. The
// user is told the editor is "provided by Rime OS", clicks it, and nothing
// happens.
//
// The binary was never the problem. `nvim --version` exits 0 on every machine
// checked, and /usr/bin/nvim is a real 64-bit ELF from
// neovim-0.11.6-1.fc43.x86_64. The launch was the problem: nvim was started
// with its stdio on pipes, drew its UI into one of them and died.
//
// src/services/AppLauncher.qml said, in a comment above the call,
// that `entry.execute()` "respects Terminal=, Path= and Exec field codes".
// That was a claim. tests/run-terminal-entry-test.sh measured it on
// quickshell-0.3.1 under a headless compositor:
//
//     term.runInTerminal = 1        Terminal=true IS parsed
//     term.command       = ["rime-probe-record"]          %F IS stripped
//     raw    → ran=1  stdout_tty=0  fd1=/dev/null   pwd=<Path=>
//     termed → ran=1  stdout_tty=1  fd1=/dev/pts/1  pwd=<Path=>
//
// So two of the three were true — the field codes are stripped and Path= is
// honoured, both measured, not taken from the comment — and the one that
// mattered was not: the program's stdio went to /dev/null. An entry
// that needs a terminal gets none, and every terminal application Rime ships —
// nvim, and anything else a package drops in with Terminal=true — is
// unclickable.
//
// ── Why the routing lives here and not in the launcher ──────────────────────
//
// There are two places a desktop entry is launched from: the launcher popup
// (src/services/AppLauncher.qml) and the dock (src/modules/Left/AppDock.qml).
// Fixing one leaves the same entry broken from the other, which is exactly the
// kind of half-repair that makes a defect look intermittent. Both now call
// here, and there is no third caller of `entry.execute()` in the tree.
//
// ── Why xdg-terminal-exec, and why nothing behind it ────────────────────────
//
// `xdg-terminal-exec` is the freedesktop helper a `Terminal=true` entry is
// supposed to be launched through: it is the one indirection that lets a user
// choose their terminal once, for the whole desktop, instead of every launcher
// hard-coding a list. Rime ships an implementation of it in rime-os
// (files/system/bin/xdg-terminal-exec, asserted present at build time in
// Containerfile.core), which resolves $TERMINAL and then the emulators the
// image actually carries.
//
// There is deliberately NO fallback chain here. A chain in QML would silently
// paper over a shell running on an image too old to carry the helper, and the
// symptom would come back later as "sometimes it opens the wrong terminal". The
// two halves are one change and land together; the image asserts the helper
// exists, so if it is missing the build is what fails, not the click.
