// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Rime Search — the decision half of the unified command surface (roadmap §15).
//
// §15 asks the launcher to stop being an app list and become "a universal
// command surface": apps, files, settings, windows, clipboard, calculator,
// commands, projects, agents, SSH hosts and package search, all behind one
// text field, with "clear permissions and previews before destructive system
// changes".
//
// Everything in this file answers one of seven questions and nothing else:
//
//   parseQuery()       what did the user actually ask for?
//   providerWants()    which providers is that worth asking, and which not?
//   score()            how well does one candidate answer it?
//   rowsFrom()         what of a provider's output may the shell render?
//   actionArgv()       exactly what argv does an action run — never a string?
//   commitDecision()   may THIS keystroke commit THIS action right now?
//   plan()             which subprocesses start, which get cancelled, and
//                      which arriving answers are stale?
//
// It is plain JavaScript rather than QML for the reason answer.js and
// manifest.js are: the QML engine loads this file with
// `import "search.js" as Search`, and Node `require`s the very same file in
// tests/search-test.js. Not a copy — the file the shell actually runs.
//
// That matters more here than anywhere else in the shell, because no CI runner
// has a compositor and every behavioural QML suite in this repo skips there.
// A launcher that can restart a service or install a package, reached by fuzzy
// match while typing, cannot have its safety rules live in a QML binding that
// nothing checks. So the rules live here and the QML is an adapter.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  THE CONTRACT, AND WHY THE BUILT-INS DO NOT GET A PRIVATE DOOR
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// P1's §16 work shipped a `launcher-provider` plugin extension point, so §15's
// "provider API so third parties can add results" already exists. What was
// missing was the set of BUILT-IN providers, and they go through the same
// contract a third-party provider uses:
//
//     property string query      written by the host, debounced
//     property var    results    read by the host
//     function activate(index)   optional; called on the host's say-so
//
// That is character-for-character the contract in PluginLauncher.qml's header.
// A built-in provider declares those three members and nothing else, and the
// host reads it through a sanitiser exactly as it reads a plugin.
//
// ── Where the two DIVERGE, which is a finding about the contract ─────────────
//
// The query→rows half is shared and identical. The ACTIVATION half is not, and
// it cannot be:
//
//   A plugin row's only action is "copy the title". That is deliberate —
//   manifest.js's launcherResults() builds each row from a four-key allowlist
//   precisely so a row cannot arrive carrying `exec` or `entry`, which
//   AppLauncher.activate() dispatches on. A provider that could name a command
//   would hold the `system` permission, which manifest.js refuses at load with
//   a reason worth re-reading: "No permission may grant a capability that
//   subsumes the others."
//
//   Every §15 command row — restart Bluetooth, install Blender, reboot —
//   has to DO something. So the built-ins need exactly one thing the plugin
//   contract cannot express.
//
// The extension is one field, and it is enumerable rather than open:
//
//     action:  an id in the ACTIONS table below
//
// Not a command. Not an argv. An ID into a closed, host-owned table that also
// owns the argv, the privilege it needs, the preview text and the class. A row
// names an action; it cannot invent one, cannot alter one, and cannot pass
// anything but one capped string as its argument. The sanitiser DROPS `action`
// from any row whose provider descriptor is not built in, so a plugin row that
// tried to carry one gets silence.
//
// That is the same shelf manifest.js put `system` on, and the note it left
// there is the door: "Until there is a specific, enumerable set of system
// ACTIONS to expose (set brightness, toggle a profile) rather than a general
// escape hatch, apiVersion 1 offers none of it." ACTIONS below IS that set.
// Handing it to plugins is therefore a permission question and not an
// architecture one — a future apiVersion can implement an `actions` permission
// over this same table, scoped to the classes it is willing to grant, without
// anything here changing shape. What it must not do is what this file
// deliberately does not do: let a provider supply the command.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  QUERY PARSING
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A universal surface has to decide what the user meant before it decides who
// to ask, because "who to ask" is where the money goes: asking the package
// index means a subprocess and possibly a metadata refresh over the network.
//
// Three kinds of query:
//
//   a SIGIL query   "?…" "=…" ">…" "~/…" "/…" "./…"
//   a VERB query    "install blender", "ssh katana", "open rime-os"
//   a PLAIN query   everything else
//
// A plain query goes only to providers that answer from data the shell already
// holds. Nothing that costs a process is reachable without either a verb the
// user typed on purpose or a path they started to spell — which is the whole
// mechanism behind "no provider may reach the network implicitly".

// "?" is NOT handled here. It is the pre-existing Wolfram|Alpha answer mode
// (see answer.js and AppLauncher), it is the one query shape that leaves this
// machine, and it stays exactly where it was: AppLauncher returns answerRows()
// and nothing else for it, and manifest.js's launcherWantsProviders() refuses
// to consult plugins on it. This file's job is to keep that true by routing
// "?" to a scope every provider gate below says no to.
var SCOPE = {
    ANSWER:   "answer",     // "?…"  — Wolfram, handled by AppLauncher alone
    ALL:      "all",        // a plain query
    CALC:     "calc",       // "=…"  — arithmetic and unit conversion only
    COMMANDS: "commands",   // ">…"  — the ACTIONS table only
    FILES:    "files",      // "~/…", "/…", "./…"
    PACKAGES: "packages",   // "install …", "remove …", "search …"
    HOSTS:    "hosts",      // "ssh …"
    PROJECTS: "projects"    // "open …"
};

// A verb is a whole word followed by a space. Requiring the space is what stops
// "installer" from being read as `install` + "er", and typing "install" alone
// from firing a package search for the empty string.
//
// `intent` is carried separately from the scope because "install blender" and
// "remove blender" ask the same index and offer different actions.

// The same reasoning manifest.js's PLUGIN OUTPUT section gives, applied to the
// built-ins — and it is not a formality here. Look at what these providers read
// from:
//
//   window titles      whatever an application chose to print
//   clipboard previews whatever was last copied, from any page in any browser
//   package summaries  whatever a packager wrote in a spec file
//   file names         whatever anything that can write to $HOME chose
//
// None of that is more trustworthy than a plugin's output. A newline in a row
// draws over two lines and can impersonate the row beneath it; a control
// character can blank what precedes it. So every string a built-in emits is
// stripped and capped, exactly as a plugin's is, and the row the shell renders
// is a FRESH object built from an allowlist rather than the provider's own
// object with the bad keys deleted.

//  THE ACTION REGISTRY
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// §15's fourth bullet is the one with teeth: "Actions should have clear
// permissions and previews before destructive system changes." A launcher that
// can `install Blender` or `restart Bluetooth` is a command surface with system
// reach, reached by fuzzy match while typing.
//
// Three classes, and the class is a property of the ACTION, not of the row:
//
//   safe         nothing persists that the user would have to undo. Launching
//                an app, focusing a window, copying text, opening a settings
//                page, opening a terminal. Enter runs these.
//   changes      alters the system or the session in a way the user would
//                notice and might not have wanted. Restarting a service,
//                installing a package, locking the screen. Enter does NOT run
//                these; it shows the preview.
//   destructive  irreversible, or ends the session, or throws away work.
//                Reboot, shut down, log out, remove a package, roll back the
//                OS, kill an agent. Enter does not run these either, and the
//                preview says plainly that it cannot be undone.
//
// ── HOW THE PRIVILEGED HALF ACTUALLY RUNS, AND WHY NOT IN-PROCESS ────────────
//
// Two mechanisms, chosen per action rather than one blanket answer:
//
//   pkexec       for a single, named, non-interactive system call — restarting
//                a unit. The polkit dialog names the program and asks for a
//                password, which is a clear permission surface in its own
//                right, and there is no output worth reading afterwards.
//
//   a terminal   for anything with a transaction to watch: package install and
//                remove, `rime update`, `rime rollback`. This is the house rule
//                the agent runtime already follows — /usr/libexec/rime-agent-
//                review opens a terminal "because approving PERFORMS the
//                operation, with the reviewing human's own root, so the
//                decision has to happen somewhere sudo can authenticate and
//                where the full prompt and the resulting output are visible."
//                A launcher that swallowed a package transaction into a
//                subprocess with no window would be hiding exactly the part
//                worth seeing — including the part where it fails.
//
// Both go through src/scripts/SearchRun.sh, which takes a VERB from a closed
// set and validates its arguments before it runs anything. That is the second
// lock on the same door: even a bug in QML that passed the wrong argument
// cannot turn a verb into a different command, because the script never
// composes one from what it was given.
//
// ── NO STRINGS. EVER. ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// argv() returns an ARRAY, and every caller must keep it one. This repo already

//  THE COMMIT RULE
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "Enter on a fuzzy match must never be the thing that reboots, uninstalls, or
// resets."
//
// The rule, in one place, as one pure function:
//
//   safe                     Enter runs it.
//   changes / destructive    Enter shows the preview. Only Ctrl+Enter commits,
//                            and only while the preview on screen is the
//                            preview for the row that is selected.
//
// ── The hole this closes, which the obvious version does not ────────────────
//
// "Enter previews, Ctrl+Enter commits" is not enough on its own. Ctrl+Enter is
// muscle-memory "send" in half the applications on this machine, and nothing in
// that rule stops it being pressed straight from the list with no preview ever
// shown. The preview would then be optional, and an optional preview does not
// meet the requirement.
//
// So commitDecision takes BOTH identities — the row the preview belongs to and
// the row that is selected right now — and requires them to be equal AND
// non-empty. No input where they differ can return "run" for a non-safe class,
// which is a single assertion the suite makes over the whole cross product.
//
// ── Why there is no arming delay ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The first draft had one: a destructive action could not be committed until
// its preview had been on screen for 600 ms. It is gone, because it stops
// nothing that the gesture does not already stop. The failure it was aimed at
// is a held Enter repeating through both stages, and that cannot happen when
// the second stage is a different chord. What it would have added is a launcher
// that ignores a deliberate keypress for half a second, which teaches people to
// mash the key. A delay that guards nothing and trains a bad habit is worse
// than no delay.

};

// commitDecision({ klass, key, ctrl, previewedId, selectedId }) → COMMIT.*
//
//   klass        the selected row's class
//   key          "enter", "commit" or "button"
//   ctrl         whether the control modifier was actually held
//   previewedId  the row id the preview panel is currently showing, or ""
//   selectedId   the row id under the selection right now, or ""
//
// `key` and `ctrl` are separate arguments on purpose. A UI that binds a
// "commit" key and forgets to check the modifier is the mistake worth catching,
// so the function checks both and refuses a "commit" that arrived without ctrl.
//
// "button" is the mouse and touch path — §15's third bullet is that the surface
// be "keyboard-first but usable with mouse/touch", and a preview only a chord
// can commit is not that. It is not a weaker gate: the Run control exists only
// inside an open preview, so pressing it IS the second deliberate gesture. It
// carries no `ctrl` because claiming a modifier was held when a finger touched

//  THE SCHEDULER

// "A keystroke must not spawn a process per provider per keystroke."
//
// This is a pure reducer rather than a pile of QML Timers, for one reason: a
// Timer's behaviour can only be observed by running a compositor, and no CI
// runner has one. A reducer can be driven by a fake clock in Node and the
// subprocesses it asks for can be counted. So "typing eleven characters costs
// one subprocess" is a MEASUREMENT in tests/search-test.js, not a claim in a
// comment.
//
// ── The state ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   on        whether anything is holding demand. false means the launcher is
//             closed, and then there is no timer, no process and no cache.
//   seq       a monotonic token. Every start gets one.
//   pending   { providerId: { seq, argv } } — what is in flight.
//   cache     { providerId: [ { argv, ok, text } ] } — recent answers, newest
//             last, bounded.
//   armed     whether the debounce deadline is outstanding.
//
// ── Why the token is per REQUEST and not a global generation ────────────────
//
// The obvious design is a generation counter bumped on every keystroke, with
// arriving results compared against it. It is wrong here, and subtly: the
// projects and hosts providers run a command that does not depend on the query
// at all. Bumping a generation on each keystroke would discard their in-flight
// answer every time the user typed another character, so a fast typist would
// never see a project. A per-request token discards only what was actually
// superseded — a request whose argv is no longer wanted.
//
// ── Why the cache is keyed by ARGV ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Because that is what makes typing free. `rime project list --json` has one
// argv for every query, so it is fetched once per launcher session. A directory
// listing's argv is the DIRECTORY, so walking "~/Doc" → "~/Documents/pro" costs
// one listing per directory rather than one per keystroke. And a package search
// that is retyped after a backspace is a cache hit rather than a second
// process.

// The debounce, in milliseconds. 160 rather than PluginLauncher's 120 because
// what sits behind this one is a subprocess rather than a QML binding: the cost
// of being early is a process that will be thrown away, and the cost of being
// late is 40 ms.

// `rime search <term>` prints two human-readable sections — `dnf5 search`
// output under a "repository packages" rule, then `flatpak search` under

// deliberate choice over adding a machine-readable mode to the OS side: this is
// the shell's problem, and a parser that fails yields no rows rather than
// wrong ones.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, TRANSCRIBED RATHER THAN ASSUMED ───────────────────────────────
//
// The first version of this function was written from memory of dnf4, which
// separates the name from the summary with " : ". dnf5 does not. Captured from
// `dnf5 search blender` on dnf5 5.2.18.0, Fedora 43, with cat -A:
//
//     Matched fields: name (exact)$
//      blender.x86_64\t3D modeling, animation, rendering and post-production$
//     Matched fields: name, summary$
//      YafaRay-blender.x86_64\tBlender integration scripts for YafaRay$
//
// A leading space, then `name.arch`, then a TAB. No colon anywhere, and the
// "Matched fields:" header repeats between groups rather than appearing once.
// The dnf4-shaped regex matched NOTHING, so the flagship §15 example —
// "install Blender" — returned the Flatpak and never the RPM that
// `rime install` would actually use for a bare name. It failed silently,
// because "a parser that fails yields no rows" is exactly what it did.
//
// Both separators are accepted now: a TAB where dnf5 puts one, and " : " for
// the dnf4 form, since rime-pkg calls whichever dnf5 is installed and the
// output of a tool is not a contract. The fixtures in tests/search-test.js are
// the captured bytes, not a reconstruction.
//
// flatpak's --columns output is tab-separated, which the same capture confirms:
//     org.blender.Blender\tBlender\tfedora,flathub$
