// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  WindowSwitcherService — the ALT+Tab switcher's state.
//
//  Andre: "build a full alt+tab switcher thing and it goes for all windows
//  including windows in other workspaces."
//
//  ── One protocol, not three IPCs ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  The window list is ToplevelManager, i.e. wlr-foreign-toplevel-management.
//  It is what the app dock already reads, it is compositor-agnostic, and it is
//  workspace-agnostic by construction: a compositor publishes every toplevel it
//  has over that protocol regardless of which workspace or output the window is
//  on. Hyprland's `hyprctl clients`, niri's `niri msg windows` and labwc's
//  nothing-at-all would have been three code paths for a list this one already
//  gives, and `activate()` on a handle is the protocol's own "switch to this",
//  which each compositor implements including the workspace change.
//
//  ── Why there is no keyboard grab ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  A real alt-tab is hold ALT, tap TAB, release ALT. The obvious way to see the
//  release is to put the overlay on a layer-shell surface with exclusive
//  keyboard focus. That is wrong HERE specifically: taking keyboard focus takes
//  it away from the window the switcher is about to activate, and "the window I
//  moved to instantly loses focus" is the defect this whole unit exists to
//  remove. It would also make the single-tap case — press and release faster
//  than the surface can map — unobservable, because the release would arrive
//  before there was anything focused to receive it.
//
//  So the COMPOSITOR reports the release, through a keybind, exactly the way it
//  reports the ALT+Tab that opened the switcher:
//
//      hl.bind("ALT + Alt_L", …, { release = true, transparent = true })
//
//  It lands here as `commit()`, as does ALT+Return — an ordinary press bind
//  that exists because nothing headless can press a real ALT and let go of it,
//  so a switcher with only a release commit could become one you can open and
//  not close. The overlay never asks for the keyboard either way, so a single
//  tap-and-release is a plain window swap with no visible switcher at all if
//  the user is quick enough — which is what an alt-tab should be.
//
//  ── Only the Hyprland session binds this ────────────────────────────────────
//
//  labwc's onRelease is documented as firing when a modifier is used WITHOUT
//  another key, and measured on 0.9.6 it fires zero times after an ALT+Tab. niri
//  has no release binding at all, and 26.04 ships its own recent-windows
//  switcher. Both sessions therefore keep the switcher they already have, which
//  in both cases is a real hold-and-release one. See docs/window-switcher.md in
//  rime-os. This service stays compositor-agnostic regardless — it reads a
//  protocol every wlroots-family compositor implements — so binding it in a
//  second session is a config change and nothing more.
//
//  ── The flag file, and the single tap ───────────────────────────────────────
//
//  The release keybind fires on EVERY ALT release, all day. So the keybinds do
//  not call the shell; they call /usr/libexec/rime-switcher, which tests for a
//  flag file first and exits without contacting anything when the switcher is
//  closed. That is what keeps a global key release cheap.
//
//  The HELPER writes that flag on `next`, not this service. A quick ALT+Tab
//  lets go of ALT about 60ms after Tab goes down, and a write at the end of
//  spawn -> rime -> qs ipc -> Process takes longer than that: the release would
//  find no flag, exit, and drop the commit, leaving the switcher open on entry
//  two so the NEXT switch committed the wrong window. This service still
//  writes the flag — on open, and removes it on close — because the helper's
//  copy is a fast path and not the record.
//
//  Press and release are separate processes and can still overtake each other,
//  which is what `_commitArrivedAt` below is for.
