// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Metrics — the geometry tokens for the REFERENCE output.
//
// Every size in here used to be an absolute pixel literal calibrated against a
// 1080p panel, which is why the shell looked correct on exactly one class of
// monitor and wrong on every other. Rime OS deliberately runs outputs at
// Hyprland scale 1.0 (an `auto` scale that cannot resolve to an integer buffer
// size errors the monitor rule out entirely, which is a worse failure than a
// small UI), so compensating for pixel density is the shell's job, not the
// compositor's.
//
// ── What this file is now ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The token table itself moved to theme/ThemeSet.qml, and this singleton is one
// INSTANCE of it: the instance whose factor comes from the reference output.
// The table is not trapped inside a singleton any more, so every output has its
// own set without a second copy of the arithmetic. That copy is the defect this
// item was opened for: tests/scaling-test.qml once re-implemented the
// breakpoint table and asserted its own copy, and every breakpoint assertion
// passed no matter what this file said.
//
// theme/OutputScale.qml answers what factor an output deserves; every surface
// builds its own instance at that factor. This one is built at the REFERENCE
// output's, which is a policy question rather than a density bucket.
//
// ── The scale factor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `scale` multiplies every geometry token and, through fs(), every font size.
// It is deliberately SUBLINEAR in resolution: a 4K panel is usually also
// physically larger, so a literal 2x would be enormous. Fixed breakpoints are
// used rather than a continuous height/1080 ratio because a continuous factor
// produces awkward fractional pixel values and shifts the whole UI on any mode
// change; breakpoints are predictable and reproducible. The table is in
// theme/scaling.js and the manual-override policy is in theme/OutputScale.qml —
// this file chooses the OUTPUT, not the arithmetic.
//
// `physicalDotsPerInch` would be the principled input, but EDID physical size is
// missing or wrong on a great many panels, and a bad DPI reading would size the
// shell absurdly with no obvious cause. Height is boring and always right.
//
// ── Who still reads this, after the migration ───────────────────────────────
// Almost nothing, and that is the point. Every surface in the shell resolves
// its OWN output's set:
//
//     readonly property ThemeSet theme: ThemeSet { scale: Theme.factorForScreen(root.screen) }     // a window
//     readonly property ThemeSet theme: ThemeSet { scale: Theme.factorForSize(Screen.width, Screen.height) }   // an Item
//
// and reads `theme.px(...)` where it used to read `Theme.px(...)`. 1042 reads
// across 99 files moved; tests/check-scale-tokens.sh's closure rule is what
// keeps them moved.
//
// This singleton remains for three things, all of them deliberate:
//
//   • `Theme.<colour>` and `Theme.animDuration` still come through here,
//     because neither is a function of an output. A palette belongs to the
//     shell; two monitors with different accent colours would be a bug.
//   • the REFERENCE output — which output's size the user considers the
//     canonical one, via `SettingsService.scaleScreen`, defaulting to the
//     tallest. Nothing lays out at it any more, but the Display page and the
//     suites ask what it is.
//   • `services/plugins/PluginService.qml`, the one file the closure rule
//     exempts: its `theme` is a versioned snapshot handed to plugin code, one
//     object for every plugin instance.
//
// The Display page's recommended scales are still worth applying, for the
// reason that was always the other half of the story: the shell is the only
// thing on the desk that magnifies itself, and every other application is drawn
// at the compositor's scale for the output it is on.
