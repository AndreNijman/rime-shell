// ─── PluginWidgets ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The `bar-widget` extension point (roadmap §16), end to end. A plugin whose
// manifest says `"extensionPoint": "bar-widget"` gets its root item mounted
// here, in the bar's right-hand cluster next to the clock and the battery.
//
// This was the only extension point in apiVersion 1.0, on the grounds that one
// working point tells you what the others need where five stubs tell you
// nothing. It did, and apiVersion 1.1 has two more:
// src/services/PluginLauncher.qml mounts `launcher-provider` and
// src/services/home/PluginTiles.qml mounts `quick-settings-tile`.
//
// The claim this file's first version made was that adding one would be a new
// host plus a name in EXTENSION_POINTS and no change to PluginService, and that
// held — PluginService gained no branch for either. What it did NOT anticipate
// is the thing the other two hosts spend most of their length on: this point
// hands a plugin a rectangle and lets it PAINT, so there is no plugin-supplied
// string for the shell to render and nothing to sanitise. The other two are
// data points — the plugin hands back rows or a state and the SHELL draws them,
// in the shell's own chrome — which is a smaller capability and a larger
// checking burden. See the PLUGIN OUTPUT section of manifest.js.
//
// §16 names nine points. Three are real; the six that are not are listed in
// manifest.js with the reason each is missing, and one of them —
// notification-handler — is missing because it would need a permission that
// does not exist rather than because nobody has written the host.
//
// ── Crash isolation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This is the practical half of §16's "crash isolation where practical". Each
// plugin sits in its own Loader:
//
//   * A plugin whose QML fails to parse, references a missing type, or throws
//     while its bindings are being set up puts that Loader into Loader.Error.
//     The bar keeps running, the other plugins keep running, and the failure
//     is recorded against that plugin instead of appearing as a shell fault.
//   * `asynchronous: true` means a slow or pathological plugin cannot stall
//     the bar's first paint. The bar is the always-mapped window; anything
//     that blocks here is visible as the whole desktop hanging on login.
//   * The size clamp below is isolation too, of a duller kind.
//
// What this does NOT isolate, and there is no point pretending otherwise: a
// plugin that hard-crashes the process (an infinite loop in a binding, a real
// segfault down in Qt) takes the shell with it, because it is running in the
// shell's process. Surviving that needs an out-of-process plugin runtime. See
// the header of PluginService.qml for where that boundary actually sits.
