#
# ── Why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# src/services/compositor/ is §17's adapter layer for QML: one facade, one
# backend per compositor, and a capability map so a consumer never asks "am I on
# Hyprland". The helper scripts could not use it — they are spawned by hypridle
# and by the power menu, outside the QML engine — so each of them grew its own
# private answer to "which compositor am I on", and each of those answers was
# incomplete in a different way:
#
#   PowerControl.sh logout      niri, else `hyprctl dispatch exit`. labwc has no
#                               hyprctl, so the Log Out button did nothing at all.
#   PowerControl.sh desktopmode hardcoded the `hyprland` session id, so leaving
#                               Gaming Mode dropped a labwc or niri user into
#                               Hyprland.
#   DpmsControl.sh              Hyprland, niri, then `exit 0`. Idle screen-off
#                               was a silent no-op on labwc.
#
# This is the one place that answers the question for scripts, in the same
# detection order as src/state/Compositor.qml, and the one place that turns an
# answer into a command. A fourth compositor is a case label here and nothing
# anywhere else.
#
# ── The single exec point ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every compositor-dependent action in these scripts runs through rime_run().
# That is what makes the coverage assertion in tests/check-compositor-backends.sh
# possible AND safe: the check can drive the real entry points of the real
# scripts for every compositor and see the command each one resolves, without
# any of them being able to run. The check also asserts that no `exec` survives
# outside rime_run, so "safe to dry-run" is enforced rather than promised.

# rime_run <argv...> — run the resolved command, replacing this process.
#
# With RIME_COMPOSITOR_DRY_RUN set, print the argv and return instead. Nothing
# in a session sets that variable; tests/check-compositor-backends.sh does.
#
# A missing program is reported here rather than left to `exec`, because some of
# these commands live in packages the compositor does not pull in (wlopm is the
# one that matters) and "wlopm: not found" from a hypridle listener at 3am is a
# message nobody will ever read as "your image is missing a package".

# rime_compositor — print hyprland | niri | labwc, or return 1 for anything else.
#
# Same order and the same signals as src/state/Compositor.qml, deliberately:
# two detectors that disagree are worse than one that is wrong. The instance
# variables come first because they prove a live compositor, and
# XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP is consulted after because it is the ONLY signal labwc
# publishes — labwc exposes no IPC socket at all by design, so there is no
# LABWC_SOCKET to test for.
#
# Returning 1 rather than guessing is the point: on sway, river or KDE this
# refuses to answer, so a caller reports "no known compositor" instead of
# spawning hyprctl into the void.
#
# RIME_COMPOSITOR overrides detection. It is what the check drives, and it is
# also the escape hatch for a packager whose session sets neither signal. The
# QML override (the "compositor" key in config_Provider.json) is NOT read here:
# these scripts run before, after and independently of the shell process, and
# parsing that file in three scripts would be the fourth answer this file exists
# to delete.

# This is the FALLBACK, not the first choice. PowerControl.sh prefers

# user units stop and the greeter comes back; killing the compositor leaves that
# to chance. But the neutral path needs a registered logind session, and off
# systemd/elogind there is none — so every compositor still needs its own answer
# here, and the coverage check enforces that all three have one.

# manager, Lua ("keyword can't work with non-legacy parsers. Use eval."). Measured in a
# nested 0.56.2 with the live appearance.lua: the still took more than 120 ms
# to become opaque, and grim 20 ms after slurp exited captured its overlay half
# faded — slurp's border, on the edges of every area screenshot.
#
# So the rule goes in through eval, once per config load. A named rule is
# reused when pushed again, but each push appends another copy of its effect
# (v0.56.2, LuaBindingsConfigRules.cpp: `rule->addEffect` on the existing rule),
# so pushing on every screenshot would grow it without bound. The Lua global is
# the guard: it survives between evals and, measured, a reload clears it along
# with the runtime rules it guards.

# animations were not measured; it gets no rule rather than a guessed one.
