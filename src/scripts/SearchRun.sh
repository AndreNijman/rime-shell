#  SearchRun.sh — every privileged or terminal-hosted action the unified search
#  surface (roadmap §15) can take, behind a closed set of verbs.
#
#  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
#
#  src/services/search.js owns the ACTIONS table: which actions exist, what
#  class each one is, what privilege it needs, and the argv that runs it. That
#  table is already a closed set, and the launcher already refuses to run a
#  non-safe action without a deliberate second gesture.
#
#  This is the SECOND lock on the same door, and it is a different kind of lock.
#  The table lives in a file the QML engine loads; this is a program that
#  receives an argv and decides for itself whether it will act on it. So a bug
#  in the shell — a row that carried an argument it should not have, a table
#  edited without thinking — meets a verb allowlist and an argument charset
#  before anything runs. Nothing here ever composes a command out of what it was
#  given; every command is written out in full, with the argument in a
#  positional slot.
#
#  WHY A TERMINAL FOR THE PACKAGE VERBS
#
#  The house rule, already followed by /usr/libexec/rime-agent-review: a
#  privileged operation belongs "somewhere sudo can authenticate and where the
#  full prompt, the reason and the resulting output are all visible". A package
#  transaction has output worth reading and a failure worth seeing. Swallowing
#  it into a subprocess with no window would hide exactly the part the user was
#  shown a preview of.
#
#  `unit-restart` is the exception and it is deliberate: one named unit, no
#  output worth reading, and pkexec's own dialog names the program and asks for
#  a password, which is a clear permission surface in its own right.
#
#  Every verb below exits non-zero on a refusal, and says why on stderr.

# arbitrary ExecStart lines, and a user-writable unit file under
# ~/.config/systemd would make this an escalation. Two units, both system

# ── The argument charset ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A package name is a Fedora package name, a Flatpak application id, or a path
# to a local .rpm — but this script never accepts the path form: a launcher row
# offering to install a file the user did not name is not a feature. So: letters,
# digits, and the four punctuation characters real package names use, and it may
# not begin with "-" (which would be read as a flag by anything downstream).
valid_name() {

# An ssh destination is an alias from ~/.ssh/config or a user@host. No spaces,
# no shell metacharacters, and never a "-" first for the same reason.

# ── Opening a terminal ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Through rime-terminal.sh beside this file: the user's default terminal
# (xdg-terminal-exec, which Settings → Misc → Default terminal writes) first,
# then the emulators it knows, each with its own exec flag — getting the flag
# wrong opens an empty terminal and that looks like the action did nothing.
# This script used to keep its own list with $TERMINAL first, and the OS
# exported TERMINAL=alacritty, so a user who chose Ghostty got Alacritty here.
#
# The command is passed to the terminal as ONE argument, and it is built here
# from constants plus a single already-validated word. It is never built from
# anything this script received unchecked.
