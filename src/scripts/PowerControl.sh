# Rime OS (Fedora bootc) is systemd. systemd's `loginctl` has NO
# poweroff/reboot/suspend verbs (those are elogind-only), so the original
# `loginctl <verb>` calls silently failed there ("Unknown command verb"). Use
# `systemctl` when it is present (polkit lets the active local session run these
# without a password: CanPowerOff/CanReboot = yes), and fall back to `loginctl`
# on legacy elogind hosts (e.g. Void/runit) where systemctl is absent.
# See ~/Projects/rime-logs/30-power-actions-loginctl.md

# Resolve the shell checkout from this script's own location (src/scripts/ →
# repo root) rather than assuming ~/.local/src/rime-shell, which is only the
# default install path. Keeps `lock` working for system-wide and relocated
# installs.
# APEX_SHELL_DIR is the override's name from before the rename; a launcher a
# developer wrote for a checkout of their own may still set it.

    # Openbox-fallback experience on the desktop §24 promises behaves like a
    # mature one.
    #
    # Preference order, most correct first:
    #
    #   1. /usr/libexec/rime-session-logout, when Rime OS ships it. Same job,
    #      already written, already tested there; calling it keeps the two repos
    #      from drifting into two different answers.
    #   2. `loginctl terminate-session $XDG_SESSION_ID` — compositor-neutral and
    #      the RIGHT answer wherever the session is registered with logind,
    #      because it tears the session down properly so user units stop and the
    #      greeter comes back. Killing the compositor leaves that to chance.
    #      Terminating your own session is allow_active in the shipped
    #      org.freedesktop.login1.manage policy, so it does not prompt.
    #      Guarded on XDG_SESSION_ID: `terminate-session` with no id is not a
    #      portable "this one".
    #   3. The compositor's own exit verb, from the adapter. This is what runs on
    #      a machine with no logind session at all, and it is the branch the
    #      coverage check requires all three compositors to have.
