# ─── rime-display-guard ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The half of a display transaction that has to outlive Rime Shell.
#
# A temporary display apply is only safe because something puts the old layout
# back when nobody confirms the new one. If that something is a QML Timer inside
# the shell, then the shell dying during the countdown leaves the machine on the
# unconfirmed layout — which is the layout the user could not confirm, quite
# possibly because they cannot see anything. "Press Apply, shell crashes, screen
# stays black until you find a TTY" is the failure this file exists to prevent.
#
# So the countdown has two owners:
#
#   the shell   draws the dialog, counts down on screen, and asks this script
#               for a verdict when the user answers.
#   this guard  is detached from the shell (setsid), holds the rollback model,
#               and restores it when the deadline passes with no verdict.
#
# Either can revert. Reverting twice is applying the same model twice, which is
# what the engine does anyway, so the race is harmless by construction rather
# than by locking.
#
# ── The transaction directory ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   target.json    the model being tried
#   rollback.json  the model that was on screen before, restored on timeout
#   deadline       epoch seconds; after this the guard reverts
#   verdict        keep | revert | cancel   — written by the shell
#   state          pending | kept | reverted | cancelled | revert-failed
#                  — written by the guard
#   guard.pid      the detached guard's pid, so `reconcile` can tell whether
#                  anyone is still watching
#
# It lives under $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, which is wiped when the session ends. That is
# correct: a transaction only means anything while the compositor it was applied
# to is still running.
#
# ── What this does NOT cover ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The guard is detached from the shell, not from the session. If the compositor
# itself dies, the guard goes with it and cannot reach a compositor to revert
# through anyway. What survives that is the persisted layout on disk, and the
# engine persists on every apply — measured, not assumed: one apply with no Keep
# writes ~/.config/kanshi/config and ~/.config/hypr/rime/monitors.lua with the
# layout nobody confirmed, and kanshi reapplies its profile at the next login.
#
# That is now closed by one flag in rime-display-apply, which lives in rime-os:
# `apply --no-persist`, so a TEMPORARY apply touches only the running compositor
# and Keep's existing `save` is the only thing that writes. DisplayService probes
# the installed engine for the flag before passing it, because this shell also
# runs on images that predate it. A session that dies mid-countdown now comes
# back on the last CONFIRMED layout, and no watchdog outside the session is
# needed at all. Spelled out, with the measurement, in
# ROADMAP/design/P0-018-display-recovery.md.
#
# This script deliberately does NOT pass the flag. `restore` is a rollback, and a
# rollback should rewrite the persisted profile whatever state the machine was
# left in — P0-018 item 4.
#
# usage:
#   rime-display-guard.sh spawn     <dir>            detach a guard for <dir>
#   rime-display-guard.sh run       <dir>            the countdown itself
#   rime-display-guard.sh verdict   <dir> <verdict>  keep | revert | cancel
#   rime-display-guard.sh status    <dir>            "<state> <seconds-left>"
#   rime-display-guard.sh reconcile <dir>            settle an abandoned txn

# ── Putting the old layout back ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The one operation that must not fail quietly, and the one place it is
# implemented: the shell's Revert button, the guard's timeout and `reconcile`
# all come through here, so all three restore the same bytes the same way.
#
# The fallbacks are the part worth reading. A rollback names the outputs and the
# resolutions that were on screen, which is the whole point of it — restoring a
# layout at "whatever the compositor considers preferred" is how a revert
# changes your resolution. But the world moves between the apply and the revert,
# and wlr-randr rejects the WHOLE invocation over any one line it cannot
# satisfy, which leaves the user on the layout they were trying to escape.
#
# Two things go stale, and both were seen happening rather than imagined:
#
#   a mode stops being offered   the output was turned off and came back
#                                renegotiated, or the transaction is being
#                                settled after a reboot.
#   an output stops existing     the fifteen seconds of a display countdown is
#                                plenty of time to pull a cable, and the whole
#                                reason someone is staring at this dialog is
#                                that a monitor is behaving oddly. Reproduced in
#                                tests/run-display-unplug-test.sh, which
#                                destroys a real wlroots output mid-countdown:
#                                before this, the revert failed outright and the
#                                machine kept the unconfirmed layout.
#
# So: try it exactly; then without the outputs the compositor no longer reports;
# then without the modes as well. A revert that gets the picture back at the
# wrong refresh rate is a bad outcome. A revert that leaves the screen off
# because one line of the model named a monitor somebody unplugged is a much
# worse one.
