    // ── What a screen reader gets from a settings page, and why it is here ───
    //
    // Measured 2026-09-19 over real AT-SPI, with the shell running on a nested
    // headless labwc and Qt's accessibility factory restored by the round-30
    // shim: the Nexus window published its controls as a FLAT list at one
    // depth, mixing several pages' controls together — Colour's `Rescan` and
    // `tonal-spot` sitting beside Recovery's `Re-check` and `Open`. Nothing in
    // the tree said which page was on screen, and nothing grouped a row with
    // the heading it belongs under.
    //
    // That is not Qt flattening anything. QAccessibleQuickItem::childItems()
    // skips items that are not accessible, so every marked leaf becomes a
    // direct child of the frame — the sections and the scroll views in between
    // simply were not there. Marking the section IS the structure.
    //
    // Grouping rather than a Heading on the title Text: a heading would leave
    // the tree flat and interleave labels, where a group makes "these rows
    // belong to Factory reset" a fact a reader can navigate and a test can
    // assert. The title is the group's name, so the words are not duplicated.
    //
    // No focus change: this adds no activeFocusOnTab and no key handling, so
    // the tab order is exactly what it was.
