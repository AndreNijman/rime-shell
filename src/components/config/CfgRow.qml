    // RTL in this shell was recorded for nineteen rounds as "the image cannot
    // render it". Round 20 measured that and it is false: Arabic, Hebrew, Thai
    // and Devanagari all fall out of the hardcoded JetBrains Mono into
    // image-owned fonts that cover them. What was actually missing is LAYOUT —
    // zero `LayoutMirroring` and zero `layoutDirection` in the whole tree — so
    // a reader of those scripts got a row whose label sat on the wrong side of
    // the side they read from.
    //
    // The switch is the application's own direction, which Qt takes from the
    // locale. Measured rather than assumed, because the image installs
    // `glibc-langpack-en` only: `Qt.application.layoutDirection` is
    // RightToLeft under LANG=ar_EG.UTF-8 and he_IL.UTF-8 and LeftToRight with
    // LANG unset, because QLocale parses the locale NAME itself instead of
    // asking the C library for a catalogue it does not have.
    //
    // `childrenInherit`, because the row's own anchors are half of it: the
    // control it holds anchors itself inside the row's right-hand slot.

    //
    // The problem this solves is structural, not a missing property. A row's
    // words — the label, the description, the reason it is switched off, the
    // effective value read back from the machine — are sibling Text items. The
    // CONTROL is a separate object with none of them, so a reader that lands on
    // the switch announces an unnamed checkbox and the user is toggling
    // something anonymous. Naming the control at each call site would mean
    // touching 294 rows across eleven pages and would rot the first time
    // somebody changed a label and not its twin.
    //
    // So the row hands its own words to whatever control was put in it. An
    // attached Accessible object is a real QObject property, so it can be
    // written from here — verified, not assumed — and a control that already
    // names itself (CfgButton carries its own label) is left alone.
    //
    // `status` is in the description on purpose: it is what the machine reports
    // is ACTUALLY in effect, and a sighted user reads it beside the control. A
    // reader that omitted it would be missing the one thing distinguishing a
    // setting that worked from one whose backend stopped listening.
    // A row whose CONTENT is the information — a command to copy, a path, a
    // version — loses that information to the adoption above: the content Text
    // has no name of its own, so it is adopted and given the ROW's label, and
    // what it actually says is replaced rather than added to. Measured on the
    // recovery page, where a reader was told "Boot the previous deployment.
    // Run this in a terminal" and never heard `sudo rime rollback`, which is
    // the entire point of that row.
    //
    // Appended to the description rather than overwriting anything, and it
    // renders nothing: this is text for a reader, not a fourth visible line.
