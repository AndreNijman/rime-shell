    // RTL in this shell was recorded for nineteen rounds as "the image cannot
    // render it". Round 20 measured that and it is false: Arabic, Hebrew, Thai
    // and Devanagari all fall out of the hardcoded JetBrains Mono into
    // image-owned fonts that cover them. What was actually missing is LAYOUT —
    // zero `LayoutMirroring` and zero `layoutDirection` in the whole tree — so
    // a reader of those scripts got a row whose label sat on the wrong side of
    // the side they read from.
    //
    // The switch is the application's own direction, which Qt takes from the
    // locale. Measured rather than assumed, because the image installs
    // `glibc-langpack-en` only: `Qt.application.layoutDirection` is
    // RightToLeft under LANG=ar_EG.UTF-8 and he_IL.UTF-8 and LeftToRight with
    // LANG unset, because QLocale parses the locale NAME itself instead of
    // asking the C library for a catalogue it does not have.
    //
    // `childrenInherit`, because the row's own anchors are half of it: the
    // control it holds anchors itself inside the row's right-hand slot.
    //
    // What this does NOT reach is recorded by tests/run-rtl-test.sh rather than
    // implied here — mirroring acts on anchors and positioners and cannot touch
    // an explicit `x:`.

    // right-to-left layout — inside the very component that declares the
    // mirroring. `anchors.left` IS resolved by LayoutMirroring (it becomes the
    // right edge), so the inset follows the reading direction; the width stays
    // a single rule, which is what the old comment here was protecting.
