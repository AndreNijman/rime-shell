    // they find nothing (the wallpaper service seeds and saves a default,
    // matugen's config is re-rendered at start). A machine coming from APEX
    // still has everything under the apex-shell names, so the first of those
    // writes would make the new directory exist, the migration would then
    // refuse to touch the old one, and the user would land on defaults with
    // their settings stranded next door. So nothing below is built until
    // src/scripts/rime-shell-migrate.sh has run: ordering by construction, not
    // by a race the migration usually wins.
    //
    // The script exits in milliseconds and always exits 0. The timer is the
    // bound on a home directory that hangs (a dead NFS mount): a desktop with
    // no bar is worse than one on defaults, so after two seconds the shell
    // starts anyway and says so.
    //
    // Once the script has found nothing left under the old names it leaves
    // ~/.config/rime-shell/.rime-shell-migrated, read synchronously at
    // completion: with it the gate opens there and then and the script does
    // not run, so every start after the one that migrated builds before
    // quickshell says the configuration loaded, as it did before the rename.
