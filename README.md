<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- **Fluid motion**: surfaces grow out of the bar and the screen's frame, and
  open and close on springs that keep their velocity when you reverse them
  mid-way. One motion system (`Motion.qml`) times everything, and Reduce Motion
  and the motion speed setting apply to all of it, Hyprland's window animations
  included
- **Settings (Nexus)**: sixteen pages in five groups (Look & feel, Input,
  Privacy & agents, Devices, System). Open it with SUPER+C or the Dashboard's
  Settings tab; the window extrudes from the centre notch
- **Dashboard**: Home, System (CPU, RAM, battery, temperatures), Agents, Tasks
  and Apps tabs, plus the Settings tab
- **Kanban/Tasks**: To Do, Ongoing and Completed lists with Priority and
  Deadlines
- **App Launcher**: apps (pinned first, then frecency-ranked recents), files,
  settings, windows, clipboard, calculator, commands, projects, agents, SSH
  hosts and package search, plus inline answers for queries typed with a leading
  `?`. Entries that set `PrefersNonDefaultGPU` (Steam) launch on the discrete
  GPU
- **Volume and brightness in the notch**: the level shows inside the centre
  notch; a separate OSD appears only over a fullscreen window, in focus mode, or
  while the Dashboard or Settings is open
- **Lock screen**: a native Wayland session lock. It arrives as the notch
  pouring down over a still of the desktop and leaves the same way in reverse;
  the password field shows one Material 3 Expressive shape per character, never
  the characters
- **Workspaces**: the capsule shows only occupied, focused and urgent
  workspaces, each dot numbered
- **Background apps**: the tray folds behind one toggle that shows how many apps
  are running in the background
- **Frame**: screen-edge strips whose corner fillets merge into the bar; on
  Hyprland the shell sets window rounding so window corners are concentric with
  the frame
- **Screenshots**: an area screenshot freezes every output while you pick the
  region
- **Material You Integration**: dynamic colors via Matugen, updated live from
  the wallpaper, in a light or dark scheme
- **Lua-Based Config**: Hyprland v0.55+ compatible
- **Multi-Compositor**: Hyprland, niri and labwc, auto-detected; Hyprland-only
  features hide themselves on the other two
- **Per-output sizing**: each surface sizes itself for the output it is on
- **Keybinds**: set your own keybind for each popup
- **Recovery**: Settings → Recovery reads `rime recover status` and
  `rime doctor` and shows what is wrong, how to roll back, and what a factory
  reset would delete (Rime OS only; read-only until you press something)
- **Network Manager**: Wi-Fi (incl. WPA2-Enterprise/802.1X), Bluetooth, VPN
  integration
- **Notifications**: a notification server with a notification centre, toasts
  and Do Not Disturb
- **Audio Control**: PipeWire volume & device management
- **Screen Recorder**: built-in recording with wf-recorder
- **Clipboard Manager**: cliphist integration for history management
- **Plugins**: bar widgets, launcher providers and quick-settings tiles; see
  [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md)
- **Customizable**: a QML-based UI you can extend

> **Note:** Rime Shell is at `v0.1.0`. The core architecture and theming pipeline are feature-complete, but you may still hit bugs; please report them in GitHub Issues.

<h2>
  Installation
</h2>

Rime OS ships the shell in its image, built from this repository's `main`, and
`sudo rime update` updates it. The installer below is for other distributions.

### One line installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndreNijman/rime-shell/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreNijman/rime-shell.git
cd rime-shell
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer:

- ✓ Detects your Linux distribution
- ✓ Detects your Window Manager and Hyprland Config
- ✓ Backs up your entire `~/.config`
- ✓ Installs all required dependencies
- ✓ Clones the repository to `~/.local/src/rime-shell`
- ✓ Updates your Hyprland config to auto-start Rime Shell and required dependencies
- ✓ Renders a portable matugen config (no hardcoded paths) into `~/.config/rime-shell/matugen.toml`
- ✓ Creates configuration directories
- ✓ Installs a tightly scoped polkit rule for passwordless sing-box VPN toggling (only when sing-box is present)
- ✓ Registers the polkit action behind the Always Unrestricted agent toggle

**After installation, restart Hyprland for changes to take effect.**

---

<h2>
  VPN (sing-box) control plane
</h2>

The VPN tab controls the [sing-box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/) VLESS/Reality
tunnel through **systemd**: `systemctl start|stop sing-box.service` to
connect/disconnect and `systemctl is-active sing-box.service` to read status.

To keep the toggle password-free without granting broad `sudo`, Rime Shell ships
a tightly scoped **polkit** rule at
[`dots-extra/polkit/49-rime-shell-singbox.rules`](dots-extra/polkit/49-rime-shell-singbox.rules).
It authorizes `start` / `stop` / `restart` of **only** `sing-box.service`
(`org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units`) for an active local session, and
nothing else. Reading status needs no rule (it is an unprivileged query).

The Arch installer drops it into `/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/` when it detects
sing-box. To install it by hand on any systemd host:

```bash
sudo install -Dm644 dots-extra/polkit/49-rime-shell-singbox.rules \
     /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/49-rime-shell-singbox.rules
```

polkitd hot-reloads `rules.d/`, so the rule takes effect at once, with no
restart. On image-based systems (e.g. Rime OS) ship it read-only under
`/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/` instead. Rime Shell assumes `sing-box.service` is
installed **disabled** (it never autostarts) with its config at
`/etc/sing-box/config.json`.

---

<h2>
  Agent sandbox default (Always Unrestricted)
</h2>

**Settings → Agents** carries one toggle. On, an agent session started from then
on runs with no Rime sandbox: it reads and writes any file you can, the same as
a program you launch yourself. Off is the normal default, where the project is
writable and the rest of `$HOME` is masked.

Switching it **on** takes your password at the desktop's polkit authentication
prompt. Switching it **off** takes effect at once and asks for nothing.

The toggle writes `sandbox` in `~/.config/rime/agent.json`, the agent runtime's
own configuration file (the one `rime agent run` reads), so the setting survives
a reboot and applies to `a` from a terminal as much as to anything started from
the shell. It moves that one key and no other, so a Claude profile set to
`bypassPermissions` survives either direction.

It grants **no root** and hands over **no secrets**. Sessions keep the kernel's
`no_new_privs` flag whichever sandbox they have, so `sudo` fails inside one,
and the secret broker performs a granted operation without ever returning the
credential.

The password prompt needs a registered polkit **action** (an action, not a
rule). It grants nothing: it declares that the id exists and that your own
password answers it (`auth_self`, not `auth_admin`, and not cached):

```bash
sudo install -Dm644 dots-extra/polkit/org.rimeos.shell.agent.policy \
     /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.rimeos.shell.agent.policy
```

The Arch installer does this for you. Without it the toggle cannot be switched
on and says so: `pkcheck` exits 127 with *is not registered*. Image builds ship
it read-only at the same path.

<h2>
  Requirements
</h2>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Matugen is required** for dynamic color generation. Rime Shell will not function correctly without it.

### Core Dependencies

<details open>
<summary><b>Runtime & Rendering</b></summary>

- **Hyprland** v0.55+: Wayland compositor (niri and labwc also supported)
- **Quickshell**: QML shell framework. Needs a build **newer than the 0.3.1
  release**: 0.3.1 publishes a single node to the accessibility bus with nothing
  under it, so a screen reader reaches none of the shell. Upstream fixed it in
  `916a0dd` seven commits after that tag, and no release carries it yet. Rime OS
  installs `quickshell-git` for this reason and the image build refuses a
  quickshell that reports no git revision.
- **Qt6**: Qt6 libraries and QML engine
- **qt6ct**: Qt6 theme configuration

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>System Tools</b></summary>

- **PipeWire**: audio server (pipewire, pipewire-pulse, wireplumber)
- **NetworkManager**: network management
- **BlueZ**: Bluetooth stack (bluez, bluez-utils)
- **Brightnessctl**: backlight control
- **Mpris**: media players
- **Playerctl**: player controls
- **UPower**: battery and power info
- **libnotify**: desktop notifications
- **Polkit**: privilege escalation
- **wl-clipboard**: Wayland clipboard (wl-copy/wl-paste)

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Theming & Wallpaper</b></summary>

- **Matugen**: Material You color generation **(REQUIRED)**
- **awww**: wallpaper daemon (Wayland)
- **ImageMagick**: image manipulation

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Recording & Utilities</b></summary>

- **wf-recorder**: screen recording (Wayland)
- **cava**: audio visualizer
- **slurp**: region/window selection
- **grim** / **grimblast**: screenshots (grimblast on Hyprland, grim on niri and
  labwc)
- **hyprpicker**: freezes the screen while you pick a screenshot area
- **wtype**: keyboard input emulation
- **cliphist**: clipboard history manager

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Hardware Management</b></summary>

- **lm_sensors**: CPU temperature & fan monitoring
- **rfkill**: Airplane mode control
- **envycontrol**: GPU switching (NVIDIA/Intel)
- **auto-cpufreq**: CPU frequency scaling
- **nbfc-linux**: laptop fan control
- **switcheroo-control**: optional; desktop entries that set
  `PrefersNonDefaultGPU` (Steam) launch on the discrete GPU through
  `switcherooctl launch`

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Hyprland Integration</b></summary>

- **hyprlock**: not used by default. The shell draws its own lock screen
  (`src/windows/Lockscreen.qml`); the Arch installer still installs hyprlock,
  and `src/config/hyprlock.conf` stays as a fallback
- **hypridle**: idle management daemon
- **hyprsunset**: blue light filter
- **hyprshutdown**: installed by the Arch installer; the power menu no longer
  calls it (shutdown, reboot and suspend go through `systemctl`; see
  `src/scripts/PowerControl.sh`)
- **xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland**: portal backend

</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>Fonts</b></summary>

- **ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd**: primary font (Nerd Font variant)
- **ttf-noto-nerd**: emoji and CJK support

</details>

### Performance

The shell forked 5-6 processes per second while idle and never got a full second
of rest. That is fixed; see [Performance](#performance-1) below for what changed
and how it is measured.

---

<h2>
Known Issues
</h2>

- **Top Bar Clipping:** The left notch stops growing at its maximum width, so
  its contents can be clipped when the background apps tray is unfolded and
  holds many items.

- **Tray icon themes:** Applications that advertise a private `IconThemePath`
  may show a fallback glyph instead of their real icon.

> [!NOTE]
> **NixOS:** this repository no longer carries a flake. Rime OS builds the shell for NixOS from its own flake (`nix/pkgs/rime-shell.nix` in rime-os), which takes this repository as a plain source input. `install.sh` does not run on NixOS.

---

<h2>
  Compositors
</h2>

Auto-detected; you can override it in Settings → Misc.

| | Hyprland | niri | labwc |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bar, notch, popups, OSD | yes | yes | yes |
| Lock screen | yes | yes | yes |
| Workspace indicator | yes | yes | yes (`ext-workspace`) |
| Active window / fullscreen unmap | yes | yes | yes |
| Idle inhibit (caffeine) | yes | yes | yes |
| Screenshots, recording | yes | yes | yes |
| Keybind editor writes live binds | yes | yes¹ | yes² |
| Keybind capture (passthrough) | yes | no | no |
| Layout indicator, gaps, blur tiles | yes | no | no |
| Night light | `hyprsunset` | no | no |
| Special/scratchpad workspace | yes | no | no |

¹ **niri.** Every save writes `~/.config/rime-shell/RimeShellKeybinds.kdl`, and
niri live-reloads its config and any file that config `include`s. Add the
`include` line (the generated file's own header gives it verbatim) to the top
level of your `~/.config/niri/config.kdl` once, and from then on edits apply
with no restart. The shell does not add the line for you, because `include`
needs niri **v25.11 or newer** and rewriting `config.kdl` would break an older
one; on a pre-v25.11 niri, paste the generated block in instead.

² **labwc.** Every save runs `/usr/libexec/rime-labwc-keybinds apply`, which
splices the bindings into the marked region of `~/.config/labwc/rc.xml` (an
XML-aware edit that leaves the rest of a file you also own alone), then runs
`labwc --reconfigure`. The helper ships in the Rime OS image. If you are running
this shell from a `$HOME` checkout on a machine without it, the save still
writes the shell's own files and skips this step (a `test -x` guard covers that
case), so labwc keeps whatever is already in its `rc.xml`.

**labwc** is a stacking compositor with no IPC by design: no D-Bus interface, no
sway/i3 socket, no `hyprctl`. Everything the shell needs from it arrives over
Wayland protocols, and labwc implements the ones the shell uses:
`ext-workspace-v1`, `ext-session-lock-v1`, `wlr-layer-shell`,
`wlr-foreign-toplevel`, `ext-idle-notify`, `wlr-output-power` and
`wlr-gamma-control`. Workspaces therefore work in full there, including
click-to-switch.

Keybind CAPTURE (recording a shortcut by pressing it inside the editor) is still
Hyprland-only. It needs the compositor to stop swallowing its own bindings while
you press them, and the shell does that by switching Hyprland to an empty
submap, `RimeShell_clean`. The tiling-specific tiles and the layout indicator
hide themselves on niri and labwc, as the table says.

To verify shell behaviour under labwc without rebooting:

```bash
tests/run-nested-labwc.sh shell.qml 20
```

That runs labwc nested inside the current session with the shell inside it, and
reports any errors or warnings.

<h2>
  Performance
</h2>

Rime Shell used to fork 5-6 processes per second while idle, and far more on a
machine where someone had opened the dashboard once. The paired measurement
below put it at **~22 process creations per second** doing nothing.

Almost none of it was necessary:

- **Every `/proc` read was a subprocess.** CPU, memory and network stats each
  ran `cat` on a timer; the network service additionally ran
  `ip route get | awk` every second to find the default interface; the CPU
  governor service ran `pgrep` plus two globbed `cat` pipelines every 2s. A
  comment in the memory service claimed `FileView` could not read virtual
  filesystems, which is false: `/proc` and `/sys` read fine in-process.
- **Nothing could stop.** Only one of seven telemetry services was a singleton,
  so the dashboard and the config page each built their own pollers, per screen,
  and the stats page gated them on an `Item`'s `visible`, which stays true
  inside a hidden window. Selecting the stats page once left six services
  polling until logout.
- **Two brightness sliders each polled `brightnessctl` once a second**, forever,
  to watch a number that only changes when a human touches a key.
- **The bar ran three `nmcli` pipelines every five seconds**, because the bar is
  always mapped.
- **Four independent 1 Hz clocks** ticked in parallel, so the process never got a
  full second of rest.

The shell now reads `/proc` and `/sys` with `FileView`; every telemetry service
is a singleton whose timer is gated on a reference count; consumers declare
demand with [`ServiceRef`](src/components/ServiceRef.qml) bound to real window
visibility; network state comes from `Quickshell.Networking` (live
NetworkManager D-Bus) instead of `nmcli`; brightness is one inotify-driven
service with no polling at all; there is one shared `SystemClock` with a
refcounted seconds tier; the app launcher uses Quickshell's native
`DesktopEntries` index instead of spawning a Python scanner per open; and pages
and popups are built on first use rather than at login.

### Measuring it

```bash
tests/measure-idle-cost.sh packaged    # the installed shell
tests/measure-idle-cost.sh worktree    # this checkout
```

`perf stat -e sched:sched_process_exec` is the obvious tool, and you cannot use
it: `perf` is absent on a stock install and `perf_event_paranoid` is 2, so it
needs root. The kernel's cumulative fork counter (`/proc/stat` `processes`)
answers the same question with no privileges.

The script is **paired and alternating**, because `/proc/stat` is system-wide
and on a real desktop the background rate is large and non-stationary: a single
floor window followed by a single shell window produces nonsense, including
negative attributions. The script stops and resumes the shell repeatedly and
reports the median paired difference, so drift cancels.

Results on a ThinkPad L16 (Ryzen 7 PRO 250), 8 pairs × 8s, every page and popup
opened once first so both shells are compared with everything built:

| | attributable process creations |
|---|---|
| Before | **+21.9/s** (all 8 pairs positive, 15.4–27.6) |
| After | **−0.75/s** (pairs scattered −5.6…+7.0) |

The "after" figure means the shell's idle cost has fallen below what this method
can resolve on a live desktop; it does not claim zero. The before-signal was
unambiguous, and the after-signal is absent.

[`tests/service-tier-test.qml`](tests/service-tier-test.qml) covers the refcount
tier's behaviour (32 assertions against real `/proc` and `/sys`); run it with
`tests/run-service-tier-test.sh`.
